This includes asteroids, so long as you are in combat at the time.  (Note that the dodges do not count while you ship is under the effects of +60% evasion from a cloak.)\nThis can be explicitly trained by finding an enemy that cannot break through your shields, and letting him fire at you.  Increasing your dodge chance (i.e. more power to engines) will help this occur quicker, but even with the default chance you can max out the skill eventually.\n\n###Engines\nExactly as for piloting, a crew member manning the engines gains one point of XP for each projectile evaded while uncloaked in combat - and so it can be trained in the same way.\n\n###Weapons\nA crew member who is manning the weapons station gains one point of experience for each weapon that is fired.  It doesn't matter whether it hits or misses, or whether it can do damage (e.g. a beam weapon fired at a shield).\n(Multi-shot weapons such as burst lasers still count as a single fire order and hence a single XP.)\nThis can be trained by firing non-lethal weapons (e.g. ones that do ion damage) repeatedly against a target that cannot damage you.\n\n###Shields\nA crew member manning the shields station gains one point of experience for each shield \"bubble\" that is brought back up during combat.  It doesn't matter why the shields were down, be that direct enemy fire, ion damage, asteroid strikes, or even manually removing and then restoring power to the shield systems.\nThis can be trained by letting a target that cannot break through all of your shields repeatedly take one layer down. (For fastest results, move your pilot away from the helm, or reduce your engines to 0 power.  This will reduce your dodge chance to 0%, ensuring that everything hits your shields.)\nNote that you used to be able to manually remove power and restore it in combat, to get points, but this has been patched.\n\n###Repair\nA crew member gains one point of experience for getting the \"finishing blow\" when repairing a (sub)system.  Note that hull breaches provide no repair experience.\nThere's no specific way to train this as it requires your systems to be damaged.  Though you can focus the XP gains by always having the same person run around and repair everything after a battle.\n\n###Combat\nA crew member gains one point of experience for getting the finishing blow when fighting an enemy crew member or (sub)system.\nThis generally gets trained in \"real\" situations.  However, since XP is gained for taking out systems, a few extra XP can be gained from boarding if one tries to take out the enemy's systems before the crew."

In English, we speak of the Holy Roman Empire; in German, it is the HRR or \"Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation\". \n\nWiktionary quotes Busching, who in 1762 explained Reich as a German understanding of \"Eminence\", from the Latin Regnum, rather than an Empire or a Realm as other cultures would understand it. \n\nOne could see it as a word used in English, Russian, Portuguese and many other languages as a designation for any kind of German kingdom, empire or absolutism, similar to how one would address a foreigner according to their origin, e.g. Senor Martinez, Monsieur Aragon.\n\nCompare it to how many cultures, including the Germans, also use the word \"Commonwealth\" or \"Soviet Union\", despite the fact that Bavaria had formed its own Union of Soviets, the Räterepublik, during the Weimar Republic.\n\nIf you're interested in knowing when the word \"Third Reich\" came into usage, it is worth noting that during Fascist Germany, the country's official name was Das Deutsche Reich, and in the USA and UK it was usually referred to as Germany, Hitler's Germany, Berlin, Reich or, the most popular term, Nazi Germany. \n\n(Sources: Neville Chamberlain's declaration of war against Germany, headlines about Germany in newspapers like the NY Times or the Times, the Daily Mail's Lord Rothermere)\n\nIn Germany itself, the idea of a third Reich stemmed from the 19th century, where it was a popular philosophical theme in literature and theology. Writers like Johannes Schlaf, who wrote \"Das Dritte Reich\" in 1899, or the German translator of Ibsen's \"The Emperor and the Galilean\", popularized the idea of the imminent arrival of a thousand years of Christianity (a kind of positive apocalypse), which would follow a third \"Reich\". And they would quote Paul the Apostle and various saints, to make it clear that the third Reich would follow the heretic lex naturalis and the lex mosaica. \n\nNazi propagandists exploited this in their articles, making it sound as if the saints had had some sort of epiphany about Hitler and the Nazis.\n\nIn other words, the Third Reich began as an abstract idea of a Christian revolution, but was assumed by Nazi writers in order to bolster Hitler's popularity and justify the drastic and bloody decisions that the Fascist government was making.\n\nIn one of the earliest examples of the Third Reich being mentioned outside of Germany, Major Strasser in the film Casablanca talks about the Third Reich as if it was just the beginning to a kind of paradisaical future or of a fourth Reich.\n\nAfter 1945, the term was used exclusively to associate only to the unsuccessful reign of Fascism in Germany, and it ceased as a philosophical or theological idea in German literary circles."

        "output": "Mosaics were traditionally made with bits of tile or glass, but it is possible to make simple ones using paper. They are a great project for school children to do while learning about different cultures throughout history. They are also a great project to do on a rainy day or over summer vacation. You can make paper mosaic masterpieces to frame and hang. You can also make paper mosaic masks to wear!\n\n## Make a simple paper mosaic\n\n1. Get some sheets of paper in different colors. Construction paper is the most popular, but you can also use scrapbook paper, paint chips, magazine pages, or even cereal boxes! What colors you need depends on your design. You don't have to use all of the colors of the rainbow. You could just use different shades of the same color, such as: light blue, medium blue, and dark blue.\n2. Cut the paper into small pieces to make your tiles. The pieces should be small, about the size of your thumbnail. You can make squares, rectangles, triangles, or even thin strips. The pieces don't have to be the same size. In fact, try to cut some smaller ones too. This way, you can fit them into tight corners. Sort your shapes by color and put them into small piles or cups. This will make it easier to find the color you need.\n3. Start gluing the pieces of paper to the outline of a shape. Lightly draw a simple shape on a sheet of paper, which will be the outline for your mosaic. When you start gluing the pieces on it, leave a small gap between each one. You can apply the glue directly to the sheet of paper, or you can apply it to the back of your tile instead. If you are using irregular shapes, including triangles, make sure that the straightest edge is on the outside of the outline—otherwise, your shape will look jagged. If you are using white school glue, apply it with a paintbrush. This will keep things less messy. If you are applying the glue directly to the paper, work only in small sections at a time, or the glue will dry too fast.\n4. Glue the rest of your tiles to the inside of your shape. If your shape has designs on the inside, like spots on a butterfly wing, outline those designs first with more tiles before filling them in. Don't be afraid to cut some pieces down to help them fit! For a more professional touch, continue aligning the pieces along the outline, going smaller and smaller with each row until you reach the center.\n5. Consider filling in the background, if desired, using a contrasting color. This will make your work stand out. If you used different colors for your shape (this includes different shades of the same color), consider using just one color for the background. This will make your shape the focus. You can also leave the background blank.\n6. Set the mosaic out to dry. If you'd like to make your mosaic last longer, coat it with an acrylic sealer or a brush-on decoupage glue, such as Mod Podge. Let it dry before moving on.\n7. Finished.\n\n\n## Make a paper mosaic mask\n\n1. Draw a large oval or rectangle on a sheet of black paper. The shape needs to be just a little bit larger than your head. Don't cut anything out yet. Use poster paper, construction paper, or cardstock for this.\n2. Draw some shapes for the eyes, nose, and mouth. You will be cutting the eyes out, so figure out where your eyes will be when you put the mask on, and place them accordingly. Keep the nose and moth simple; you will be filling them in with tiles. A triangle for the nose and a rectangle or sausage shape for the mouth would be perfect!\n3. Cut some colored paper into small tiles. You can use construction paper, scrapbook paper, or paint chips for this. The shapes can be squares, rectangles, triangles, or even a combination of all three. They can be different sizes, but try to make them no larger than your thumbnail. You will need at least two different colors for this: one color for the mask and a contrasting color for the nose and mouth. For a different look, paint your own paper, let it dry, then cut it out. Sort your shapes by color. This will make it easier to find the color you need.\n4. Start gluing your paper tiles to the edge of your mask. Leave a small gap between each tile, and make sure that it doesn't go past the edges of the paper shape. You can use a glue stick or white school glue. If you are using white school glue, apply it using a paint brush. This will make things less messy.\n5. Glue some more tiles to the inside edges of the nose and mouth. This way, your nose and mouth won't be too big. Remember to leave a slight gap between each tile. For a cleaner finish, align any straight edges with the outline, and keep pointy edges on the inside of the shape. Use your contrasting color(s) for this. It will help them stand out better.\n6. Outline the outside of the eyes with more tiles, if desired. Don't fill the eyes in. You will be cutting them out later. You can use the same color you will use for the inside of the mask, or you can use a contrasting color.\n7. Start filling in your mask with tiles. You can glue them down randomly, or you can follow the curves of the outlines as you work your way towards the center. Remember to leave slight gaps between each tile. Use your contrasting color for the nose and mouth.\n8. Let your mask dry. If you'd like to make your mask last longer, you can seal it with a clear, acrylic sealer or a brush-on decoupage glue, such as Mod Podge. Remember to let the mask dry after sealing it.\n9. Cut the mask and the eyes out. If you are a child, ask an adult to help you cut the eyes out. You can cut the mask itself out using a pair of scissors, but you will need a shape craft knife (such as an Xacto knife) to cut the eyes out.\n10. Punch some holes to either side of the mask, and thread some ribbon or elastic through them. The holes should be at about ear level, or just where the eyes are on your mask. This will make the mask more comfortable to wear.\n"

That's usually very laborious. \n\n> Are there any guidelines available for determining which to use ?\n\nShallow embeddings are very useful to import result proved in the object logic. For instance, if you have prove something in a small logic (e.g. separation logic) shallow embeddings can be a tool of choice to import your result in Coq.\nOn the other side, deep embedding are almost mandatory when you want to prove meta-theorems about the object logic (like cut-elimination for instance).    \n\n> Is it possible to switch between the two representations in any systematic fashion?\n\nThe idea behind the shallow embedding is really to work directly in a model of the object formulas. Usually people will maps an object formula P directly (using notations or by doing the translation by hand) to an inhabitant of Prop. Of course, there are inhabitants of Prop which cannot be obtained by embedding a formula of the object logic. Therefore you lose some kind of completeness. \n\nSo it is possible to send every result obtained in a deep embedding setting through an interpretation function. \nHere is a little coq example: \n```\nInductive formula : Set :=\n    Ftrue : formula\n  | Ffalse : formula\n  | Fand : formula -> formula -> formula\n  | For : formula -> formula -> formula.\nFixpoint interpret (F : formula) : Prop := match F with\n    Ftrue => True\n  | Ffalse => False\n  | Fand a b => (interpret a) /\\ (interpret b)\n  | For a b => (interpret a) \\/ (interpret b)\n end.\nInductive derivable : formula -> Prop :=\n    deep_axiom : derivable Ftrue\n  | deep_and : forall a b, derivable a -> derivable b -> derivable (Fand a b)\n  | deep_or1 : forall a b, derivable a -> derivable (For a b)\n  | deep_or2 : forall a b, derivable b -> derivable (For a b).\nInductive sderivable : Prop -> Prop :=\n    shallow_axiom : sderivable True\n  | shallow_and : forall a b, sderivable a -> sderivable b -> sderivable (a /\\ b)\n  | shallow_or1 : forall a b, sderivable a -> sderivable (a \\/ b)\n  | shallow_or2 : forall a b, sderivable b -> sderivable (a \\/ b).\n(* You can prove the following lemma: *)\nLemma shallow_deep :\n   forall F, derivable F -> sderivable (interpret F).\n(* You can NOT prove the following lemma :*)\nLemma t :\n   forall P, sderivable P -> exists F, interpret F = P.\n```"

However, in my final series, I intend to make him turn to the dark side and oppose my other protagonists (from my other series). It's clear in his series that the protagonist-turned-antagonist is very devious, and he has had hostile intentions previously towards the protagonists of the other series.\nMy question:\nShould I avoid turning my protagonist into an antagonist? Are there any foreseeable problems with this? Will this be a problem for readers? Any tips or tricks to handle this?",
        "output": "Sounds like a great idea!\n\nSeriously though: the antagonist is the single most important character to any plot. The very best antagonists have motivations and feelings that readers can understand and empathize with. A former protagonist as an antagonist sounds really good. Both the reader and the author should be in for a fun ride, because it is very likely you will see your character grow in ways you didn't expect when you had them boxed in as a \"good guy\". \n\nThink about people you know in real life. If you really observe people, you come to understand that nobody is a \"good guy\". Sure there are people who are generally good and generally do good things, but nobody is perfect, and even the best people have thoughts and motivations you may not approve of. Even more interesting is the fact that two people can be absolutely opposed to one another without either one being objectively \"wrong\" or \"evil\". They might just have goals and motivations that are diametrically opposed.\n\nImagine a city council wants more tax money to build a park. A local business wants to pay less tax money so they can afford to give Christmas bonuses. The business owner isn't \"evil\", in fact, he wants to give Christmas bonuses! The city council isn't \"evil\" either, they just want a park for the kids. Sometimes goals just conflict in an irreconcilable way. That's the real world. That kind of plot provides a lot more food for thought than a two dimensional \"good versus evil\" morning cartoon romp. "

        "output": "## Prevention\n\n1. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. Use a disposable tissue and flush it down the toilet or throw it in a trash can immediately (don't put it down on any surface). Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer right afterwards. If you don't have anything to cough or sneeze into, cough or sneeze into the inside of your elbow rather than your hand. Change your clothing (if you were wearing long sleeves) or wash your arm as soon as you can. Carry tissues with you and offer them to others.\n2. Keep your hands clean. Wash your hands throughout the day, especially after touching other people or any surface that others have touched. Carry alcohol-based sanitizer with you. Offer it to others. Avoid touching your face unless your hands are just cleaned.\n3. Don't share utensils or drinks. In cafeteria settings, it's not uncommon for people to casually share utensils or take a sip from someone else's drink. This should be completely avoided if there is any risk of a flu pandemic.\n4. Wear a face mask or respirator as instructed by authorities. If used correctly, face masks and respirators may help prevent some exposure to flu viruses. However, face masks should be used along with other preventive measures, such as frequent hand washing.\n5. Stay healthy. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids, and eat nutritious food. The healthier you are, the better your immune system will be at defending your body against a virus.\n\n\n## Preparation\n\n1. Know what to expect. A vaccine for pandemic flu may not be available for 4-6 months after a pandemic starts, and even then, it may only be available in limited amounts. People will have little or no immunity to pandemic flu since it is a new virus to humans. With seasonal flu, people have some immunity built up from previous exposure to the viruses. Symptoms of pandemic flu may be more severe than seasonal flu. More people are likely to die from pandemic flu than from seasonal flu.\n2. Stock up. Store nonperishable foods, bottled water, over-the-counter drugs, health supplies, and other necessities. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recommends having a 2-week supply. (These supplies can be useful in other types of emergencies, such as power outages.) Have basic, over-the-counter health supplies such as a thermometer, facemasks, tissues, soap, hand sanitizers, medicine to relieve fever, and cold medicine.\n3. Plan ahead. Plan for what you will do in the following cases:\n\t* Schools dismissed: Consider childcare needs. Plan home learning activities and exercises. Have materials, such as books, on hand. Also plan recreational activities that your children can do at home. You or family member becomes sick and requires care: Make plans for how to care for people with special needs in case the services they rely on are not available. Plan to stay home for at least 10 days when you are sick with pandemic flu. Staying home will keep you from giving it to others. Make sure others in your household also stay home when they are sick. During a severe pandemic, stay home if someone in your household is sick with pandemic flu. Transportation networks disrupted. Think about how you can rely less on public transportation during a pandemic. For example, store food and other essential supplies so you can make fewer trips to the store. Prepare backup plans for taking care of loved ones who are far away. Consider other ways to get to work, or, if you can, work at home.\n4. Talk to your employer. Ask your employer about how business will continue during a pandemic. You can Develop a Risk Management Plan that accounts for the possibility of a flu pandemic. Find out if you can work from home, or if your employer will consider virtualizing the workforce. Plan for the possible reduction or loss of income if you are unable to work or your place of employment is closed. Check with your employer or union about leave policies.\n5. Stay updated. Identify sources you can count on for reliable information. If a pandemic occurs, having accurate and reliable information will be critical. Reliable, accurate, and timely information is available at http://www.pandemicflu.gov. Another source for information on pandemic influenza is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Hotline at: 1-800-CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636). This line is available in English and Spanish, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY: 1-888-232-6348. If you do not live in the U.S., check if there is an equivalent hotline in your area. Look for information on your local and state government Web sites. Review your state's planning efforts and those of your local public health and emergency preparedness officials. Listen to local and national radio, watch news reports on television, and read your newspaper and other sources of printed and Web-based information.\n"

        "instruction": "How to hold your breath for long periods of time?",
        "output": "The ability to hold your breath for a long period of time is a much sought-after skill. Maybe you want to last longer underwater while diving or surfing, or maybe you're just looking for an impressive party trick. Whatever the reason, it is actually surprisingly easy to increase the amount of time you can go without breathing, provided you use the right training techniques and follow adequate safety precautions. Read below to find out how.\n\n## Optimize your lung capacity\n\n1. Do exercises to increase your lung capacity. While there is no way to increase your lung size, there are many ways to increase the amount of air your lungs take in, and the efficiency with which they capture oxygen. In particular, a rigorous exercise routine can help to strengthen your lungs and maximize their capacity to hold air. Do plenty of cardio. Incorporating some intense cardio workouts into your weekly routine can do wonders for your lungs. Running, skipping, aerobics and swimming are all great forms of cardiovascular exercise which get the blood pumping and the lungs working hard to supply the body with the oxygen it needs to keep going. Try doing exercising in intense 30 minute bursts, pushing your body to its limits, to achieve the best result. Exercise in water. Exercising in water (swimming, water aerobics, underwater weight training) is also a form of cardio exercise, but the water provides an element of resistance which requires the body to work harder to complete each task. As a result, the lungs need to work harder to supply the body with oxygen, causing their air capacity to increase significantly over time. Work-out at high elevation. At higher elevations, there is less oxygen in the air, meaning your lungs have to work harder to supply the body with oxygen. This is an excellent way to strengthen the lungs, but you must be careful not to train to hard, or you could potentially fall victim to altitude sickness.\n2. Lose weight. Any excess baggage reduces your body's efficiency in using oxygen, as there is increased body mass to which your blood must pump oxygen. As a result, many competitive breath holders will attempt to shed any extra pounds in the weeks coming up to a competition. This weight loss should be achieved in a strictly healthy way - through exercise and balanced diet - as weakening your body through crash dieting will negatively impact your ability to hold your breath. The world record breath holder, Aleix Segura Vendrell, is reported to have lost weight for 4 months before attempting to beat the world record for holding breath underwater, in an effort to improve his ratio of body volume to lung volume.\n3. Quit smoking. The fact that smoking has a negative impact on lung strength and capacity is common knowledge. Quitting can considerably increase your lungs' ability to release carbon dioxide and absorb oxygen, even within a matter of weeks. So if you are trying to strengthen your lungs and increase their capacity, giving up smoking is undoubtedly the first thing on the to-do list. You should also try to avoid second-hand smoke as far as possible, as inhaling someone else's cigarette smoke can have a negative effect on your lungs.\n4. Take up a wind or brass instrument. These types of instruments require plenty of lung power, making them a great way to improve lung strength and increase your ability to control your breathing. And aside from that, playing an instrument is a fantastic life skill, which can provide immense personal satisfaction. The flute, clarinet, oboe and saxophone are all good options when it comes to wind instruments, while the trumpet, trombone and tuba are popular brass options. If you have a good voice, singing is another great musical aid to improving lung power. Singing requires immense control of one's breathing, making it an excellent complimentary activity for aspiring breath-holders.\n\n\n## Train techniques for hold your breath\n\n1. Practice deep breathing. Before holding your breath, inhale and exhale slowly from deep within your diaphragm. By doing this, you're ridding your lungs of low-quality air. Spend five seconds breathing in, then hold the breath for one second, before breathing out for ten seconds. Continue deep breathing for two minutes, and be sure that when you exhale, you push out every last \"drop\" of air. As you exhale, push your tongue up against your teeth.This forms a valve which helps to control the release of air. Your breath should make a hissing sound as it is released. Deep breathing allows your body to take in excess oxygen, which it can then store in the blood cells. This helps when holding your breath as your body can use the stored oxygen to continue functioning, even when you are not breathing.\n2. Purge the CO2 from your lungs. When holding your breath, the pressure you feel in your lungs is not the result of a need to breathe, but rather the result of a build-up of CO2, fighting to be released. This build-up of CO2 becomes increasingly painful as time goes on. To minimize this build-up, it is necessary to purge any pre-existing CO2 from your lungs, before holding your breath. To do this:\n\t* Exhale forcefully, pushing as much air out of your lungs as possible. Puff out your cheeks as you do this, and imagine you are trying to blow a toy sailboat across a stretch of water. Once you have exhaled completely, inhale quickly and repeat. Try to keep your body as still as possible while you do this, to avoid expending any of the stored oxygen from the previous step.\n3. Take a breath and hold it for one minute and thirty seconds. This is a practice run which will allow your body to adjust to the sensation of going without air. Use a timer to count down the 90 seconds, and don't attempt to hold your breath for any longer just yet. When you inhale, don't breathe in so much that you're about to pop; this creates tension in your body and causes you to expend more energy. Instead, fill your lung capacity to about 80-85% capacity so that you still have room to relax. Once the 90 seconds is up, exhale briefly to rid your lungs of the used air, then take three breaths, inhaling and exhaling fully. This is known as semi-purging.\n4. Repeat the process of deep breathing and purging, then hold your breath for two minutes and thirty seconds. Once the first 90 second practice run is up, repeat the deep breathing and purging exercises. Perform each exercise for a duration of one minute and thirty seconds. Once this is done, take a breath and hold it for two minutes and thirty seconds, timing it on a stopwatch. Do not attempt to hold your breath for any longer than this. Once the time is up, exhale to release the used air and take three semi-purge breaths. Follow this with two minutes of deep breathing and a minute and a half of purging. You are now ready to try holding your breath for as long as possible.\n5. Splash cold water on your face. At this point, you may decide to splash your face with some cold water before attempting to hold your breath. It has been observed that putting a person's face in contact with cold water triggers bradycardia, or the slowing of the heart rate, which is the first phase of the mammalian diving reflex. However, this step is purely optional. You don't need to actually put your entire head underwater, though. Just splash some cold water on your face right before you hold your breath, or try using a cold, wet washcloth. Don't use an ice pack instead of water, though; the same study suggests that the shock of something too cold triggers other reflexes. Just make sure the water is at a temperature of approximately 70 °F (21 °C) and that the rest of your body is in a relaxed position.\n6. Take a breath and hold it for as long as possible. Assume a comfortable seated position and take a deep breath, filling your lungs to about 80-85% of capacity. Hold your breath for as long as possible, staying completely still to avoid expending unnecessary energy and wasting oxygen. It is usually better to have someone else timing your progress, as time will pass more quickly and you will be able to hold your breath for longer if you are not constantly watching the clock. Holding your breath for long periods of time can be painful, and it usually necessary to find a way to distract yourself if you are to successfully achieve your goal. One popular distraction technique is to move through the alphabet from A to Z, thinking of a friend, celebrity or historical figure whose name begins with each letter. Aleix Segura Vendrell, who set a world record for holding his breath underwater for 24 minutes and 3 seconds, is a proponent of this very technique. Don't hold air in your cheeks. This method is meant for an air reserve, which requires \"letting go\" of the air in your lungs and switching it with the air in your cheeks. This is known as \"circular breathing\" and can be very difficult to achieve, usually resulting in the breath-holder losing both air reserves. Therefore, it may be best to avoid this method for the time being.\n7. Relax every muscle in your body. It is vital that you relax completely and release any tension from your body as you hold your breath. Close your eyes and focus on releasing the tension from each body part in turn, starting with your feet, and moving slowly upwards along your body, all the way up to your neck and head. By doing this, it is possible to significantly lower your heart rate and increase the time you are able to hold your breath for. Concentrate on something that's relaxing to you. When you can't concentrate anymore, distract yourself by doing something with your hands, like counting to 99 with your fingers. Try not to move during any point when holding your breath. When you move, you waste oxygen and that will cut down the time you're able to go without breathing. Stay still.\n8. Exhale slowly. When you can't hold your breath anymore, try to avoid exhaling all the air in your lungs in a mad rush. First, exhale about 20% of your air, then inhale again so that oxygen gets to your most critical areas faster. Then you can exhale and inhale completely.\n9. Repeat these steps 3-4 times per session. It is not recommended to do this any more, as it could damage your lungs and body. Try one session in the morning and one session at night if you wish. Keep practicing and before you know it, you will be able to hold your breath for several minutes.\n\n\n## Take the necessary safety precautions\n\n1. Always practice with a partner. It is highly advisable that you practice holding your breath with a partner. The main reason for this is that they can ensure your safety if you happen to pass out (which is fairly common during limit-testing training sessions), preventing you from hurting yourself and taking care of you while you recover your senses. In addition, a partner can help to time your breath-holding sessions, notifying you at each 30 second interval.\n2. Practice sitting up, rather than lying down. The best position to practice holding your breath in is sitting upright in a comfortable position, such as on a sofa or armchair. This allows you to expend as little energy as possible while holding your breath. It is not advised that you lie down while holding your breath, as you run the risk of choking on your tongue if you happen to pass out.\n3. Do not attempt to do this underwater, unless supervised by a professional. Although the purpose of learning to hold your breath for longer is usually for use underwater, you should never do underwater training alone, without supervision. As mentioned before, it is quite common for people to black out or lose consciousness after holding their breath for prolonged periods, and if this happens underwater it can lead to drowning. Even practicing with a partner can be dangerous, as an untrained eye may be unable to tell the difference between someone who is holding their breath and someone who has passed out. If you do decide to practice with a partner, make sure that you decide on a hand signal which you can give at regular intervals to indicate to your partner that you are okay.\n"

But that isn't the question. The question is why? Are there any references in JLS which confirms this behaviour, especially of the 2nd case?",
        "output": "The difference is that the explicit type of the ```returnsNull()``` method affects the static typing of the expressions at compile time:\n```E1: `true ? returnsNull() : false` - boolean (auto-unboxing 2nd operand to boolean)\nE2: `true ? null : false` - Boolean (autoboxing of 3rd operand to Boolean)\n```\nSee Java Language Specification, section 15.25 Conditional Operator ? :\n\n* For E1, the types of the 2nd and 3rd operands are ```Boolean``` and ```boolean``` respectively, so this clause applies:\n\n  If one of the second and third operands is of type boolean and the type of the other is of type Boolean, then the type of the conditional expression is boolean.\n\nSince the type of the expression is ```boolean```, the 2nd operand must be coerced to ```boolean```.  The compiler inserts auto-unboxing code to the 2nd operand (return value of ```returnsNull()```) to make it type ```boolean```.  This of course causes the NPE from the ```null``` returned at run-time.\n* For E2, types of the 2nd and 3rd operands are `````` (not ```Boolean``` as in E1!) and ```boolean``` respectively, so no specific typing clause applies (go read 'em!), so the final \"otherwise\" clause applies:\n\n  Otherwise, the second and third operands are of types S1 and S2 respectively. Let T1 be the type that results from applying boxing conversion to S1, and let T2 be the type that results from applying boxing conversion to S2. The type of the conditional expression is the result of applying capture conversion (§5.1.10) to lub(T1, T2) (§15.12.2.7).\n\n\n* S1 == `````` (see §4.1)\n* S2 == ```boolean```\n* T1 == box(S1) == `````` (see last item in list of boxing conversions in  §5.1.7)\n* T2 == box(S2) == `Boolean\n* lub(T1, T2) == ```Boolean```\n\nSo the type of the conditional expression is ```Boolean``` and the 3rd operand must be coerced to ```Boolean```.  The compiler inserts auto-boxing code for the 3rd operand (```false```).  The 2nd operand doesn't need the auto-unboxing as in ```E1```, so no auto-unboxing NPE when ```null``` is returned.\n\n\nThis question needs a similar type analysis:\nJava conditional operator ?: result type"

        "instruction": "How to wax your armpits?",
        "output": "Waxing your armpits may be more painful than shaving, but it keeps your armpits hairless for 4-6 weeks. You can reduce the pain and prevent ingrown hairs from occurring by preparing your armpits and using the right kind of wax.\n\n## Get ready to wax\n\n1. Prepare your underarms. You can wax your armpits without making a lot of preparations, but if you take these measures the experience will be less painful and more effective:\n\t* Clean your underarms thoroughly. Wash them with soap or a good body wash, and scrub them a little to exfoliate the skin. If you use hot water, the hairs and surrounding skin will soften, making the hairs easier to remove. Trim the hair. If the hair under your arms is longer than ⁄4 inch (0.6 cm), you should trim it with a pair of barber or nail scissors until it's ⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) long. This makes the waxing process less painful.\n2. Wrap yourself up in an old towel. The wax is bound to spill and create a mess when you try to do it yourself, so it's best to be either naked or wrapped in something you don't mind getting impregnated with wax.\n3. Powder your underarms. Any talcum powder would do. Take a big sponge and spread the talc over the area, making sure to remove the excess powder.\n4. Heat up body wax. Make sure you use wax that is intended to be used to remove leg and body hair, rather than wax intended for use on the face. Follow the instructions on the package and heat the wax in the microwave or in a wax heater. It's ready to use when it's completely melted and runny. If this is your first time waxing, do a test on the back of your hand, where your skin is less sensitive, to make sure the wax isn't too hot. Body wax kits are available at drugstores and beauty supply stores. You can make your own sugar-based body wax using the following recipe: mix 2 cups of sugar with 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup lemon juice. Heat the mixture over low heat on the stove until the sugar dissolves and becomes a sticky syrup. The mixture is now ready to use.\n\n\n## Apply the wax\n\n1. Use a waxing stick to apply wax to your armpit. Load it with a good amount of hot wax, then swipe it on your armpit in the direction of your hair growth. Continue swiping, always in the same direction, until all of the hair is covered with wax. Some people have hair that grows in more than one direction. If this is the case with you, you'll have to wax your armpit one section at a time. Do not swipe the wax in the opposite direction. Your hair strands will get tangled up and won't pull out cleanly.\n2. Apply a wax strip. Take one of the paper wax strips that came with your kit. Place it over the area with the wax and swipe it once with your hand, in the direction of your hair growth, to position it in place. If you made your own sugar wax, use a clean piece of cotton cloth as a wax strip. Leave the edge of the strip free of the wax, so you can grasp it to pull it off. If you can't cover all of the wax with one strip, work one at a time.\n3. Remove the strip. Grasp the strip by the free edge and pull quickly against the direction of your hair growth. The strip, wax, and hair should come right off. Repeat the process with the other armpit. If the wax and hair don't come off, you'll have to try again. Use a fresh wax strip. If the process is too painful, remove the wax with olive oil and warm water, and plan to shave instead of waxing.\n\n\n## Finish the job\n\n1. Examine your armpits in the mirror. If you see bits of remaining hair, apply more wax, smooth on a wax strip, and rip it off.\n2. Remove excess wax with oil. Use the oil that came with your waxing kit or a bit of olive or almond oil to rub the areas you waxed. The oil will loosen the wax from your skin, making it easy to peel it off without pain.\n3. Clean the area. Once all of the wax has been removed, wash your armpits with warm water and a mild soap. You can apply aloe if your armpits are still stinging. If the waxing caused you to bleed, put on a small bandage until the bleeding has subsided. Do not use deodorant, moisturizer, or other creams and lotions for several hours after waxing.\n"

You might \"flip the bird\" to someone who has cut you off, insulted you, or otherwise provoked your ire. At its simplest, flipping someone off is just pointedly displaying your middle finger in their direction. More advanced techniques take on an element of comedy or performance art. Remember: when you flip someone off, you are calling him or her out – so use with caution, or be prepared for the consequences!\n\n## Basic flip-off move\n\n1. Give someone the finger. There is a simple straightforwardness to the classic \"flip-off.\" Turn the back of your fist toward someone, as though you are shaking a fist at them. Then, extend your middle finger. Hold the pose and look the person in the eye. This is a quick and easy way to get the point across. Wave your finger around for emphasis. Hold it out firmly and emphatically to make sure that you get the point across.\n2. Try using both hands. For added effect, whip out the \"double-finger\" flip-off. Flip the person off with both middle fingers at the same to show them that you are unusually angry. Do \"the X\": cross your middle fingers into an \"X,\" and then hold them against your chest facing the offender.\n3. Switch fingers. For a somewhat more dynamic insult, flash your left and right middle fingers at the person in rapid succession. Alternately, keep both middle fingers extended and wave them around for emphasis.\n\n\n## Discreet flip-off move\n\n1. Act like you are itching your nose. Reach up to your face as though you are going to itch your nose or your face. Look in the direction of the person that you want to flip off. Then, use your middle finger to scratch your nose while staring pointedly. The person that you are flipping off might not notice this move. However, it might give other onlookers a laugh.\n2. Flip the person off behind their back. You might feel a bit better simply by releasing your anger somehow, even if the person in question doesn't actually see you. Consider whether you want to provoke a confrontation, or just get your feelings out.\n\n\n## Theatrical flip-off move\n\n1. Do the \"jack-in-the-box\" flip-off. Hold your fist out in front of you, knuckles facing the offender – but do not raise your middle finger yet. Then, make a fist with the other hand, and crank it in circles next to the first hand as though you are winding up an old-timey jack-in-the-box toy. As you crank, hum \"Pop Goes the Weasel,\" the tune traditionally associated with jack-in-the-boxes. Hum and crank faster and faster as you approach the end of the tune. Then, at the final \"Pop\" of the \"Pop Goes the Weasel\" tune, extend your middle finger as though it is the jack popping out of the box. Finish humming the tune while flipping the person off. Make sure that you have the person's undivided attention. This move takes a bit of time to pull off, and you want to make sure to get the full effect.\n2. Practice \"the balloon.\" Hold your fist in front of your face and put the tip of your thumb in your mouth. Act as though you are blowing up a balloon: \"blow\" into your thumb, and slowly extend all of your fingers as though your breath is inflating them. Then, hold you middle finger of the \"balloon hand\" with your other hand, and move the thumb away from your mouth. Slowly close the other fingers on your \"balloon hand\" until only your middle finger is left pointing at the person whom you want to flip off.\n3. Pretend to \"find\" your middle finger. Act as though you are looking for something: in your pocket, or between the couch cushions, or in a desk drawer. Make sure that you get the person's attention. Then, make a show of being relieved that you have found the thing you're looking for. Turn to show the person what you found: and flip them off! Alternately, lean down in front of the person as though you are picking something up off of the ground. Come up flashing your middle finger, and say, \"Did you drop this?\"\n4. Try \"the trumpet.\" Blow on your thumb while pretending to play the trumpet, and flail your fingers as though you are hitting the valves. Periodically hold up only your middle finger. Add some musical effects for style!\n5. Try the \"double extreme.\" Extend the middle fingers of both hands. Then, bring your arms behind your back and through your legs. You should have both middle fingers clearly presented. Note: only people with long arms can pull this off.\n"

        "output": "Whether or not you are an asshole depends on the dynamics of your relationship and the specific context. Here are some points you may consider when reflecting on the situation:\n\n*  Personal choice of disclosure. Whether or not to disclose your parents’ sexual orientation is your personal choice. You may have had valid reasons for not sharing this information with your girlfriend earlier, such as respecting your parents’ privacy and not finding a good time to bring this up. \n*  Your girlfriend’s expectation. Depending on the level of closeness in your relationship, your girlfriend may expect certain levels of openness and honesty. If you have been in a higher level of intimacy, she may expect you to share your personal information including your family status with her. She may feel deceived or hurt if she discovers that you withheld information about your parents’ sexual orientation. \n*  Your girlfriend’s attitude towards LGBTQ+. If your girlfriend is supportive of the LGBTQ+ group, she may feel uncomfortable with your non-disclosure of your parents’ sexual orientation, as she might feel her values were questioned and you failed to respect her values. \n*  Reflection on your motivation.  Take a moment to reflect on your motivations of not disclosing your parents’ sexual orientations to your girlfriend. Did you hide from her intentionally? Or were you worried about your girlfriend’s reactions to your disclosure? Reflecting on your intentions will help you better understand how your actions may have affected your relationship. \n\nTo sum up, while it’s up to you to decide what information you want to share with your partner, understanding the dynamics of your relationship and reflecting on how the situation developed is important. It is normal for relationships to experience conflicts because it often serves as a learning curve for both parties. You can resolve conflicts by voicing your worries and thoughts,  having open and honest communication with your girlfriend and being clear about what you want, etc."

        "instruction": "How to walk a slackline?",
        "output": "## The basics\n\n1. Start with a short slackline. The shorter the distance between the two anchor points, the more stable the slackline. As the slackline gets longer, a few things happen:\n\t* The tension in the line increases, making dismounts more dangerous due to the extra force;\n\t* The height of the line off the ground increases to allow for greater sag when weighted;\n\t* It requires more force to tighten it, which can be difficult with some tightening systems.\n2. Place one foot lengthwise in the middle of the slackline. Starting barefoot is a good idea. Using bare feet will allow you to feel the line better and find your balance more quickly. Step on the line so that it runs from between your big toe and second toe back to the middle of the heel. As you improve, practice turning your feet and standing sideways, with your shoulders parallel to the line. Once you improve (or if the landing is not safe for bare feet), you may want to switch to shoes since they provide greater protection when attempting tricks and landing.\n3. You can mount the slackline at any point, but starting in the middle is generally safer, since it is usually away from obstacles you might hit when falling. The line is also lower to the ground in the middle once weighted, reducing the height of the falls. Practice from the same place each time since the slackline oscillates differently at different distances from the anchors. The wobbles are faster and smaller near the anchors and slower and larger near the middle. But wherever you start, it is going to wobble a lot. This is natural; everyone wobbles the first time.\n4. Take a couple deep breaths and settle yourself. If you are relaxed, your foot will be less shaky on the line.\n5. Focus intently on a single point, such as the anchor. This will help you find and keep your balance. Resist the temptation to look straight down at your feet on the line. Looking down at the wobbling line will simply make you wobble as well. Look ahead instead of down at the line.\n6. Put your arms out wide, slightly bent and keep an upright posture.\n7. Center your weight directly over the foot on the line. With one smooth, balanced motion stand up on that leg.\n8. Balance on one foot, while using your arms and other leg to help maintain your balance.\n9. Bend the leg that is on the slackline. Bending your leg lowers your center of gravity slightly, and allows you to more easily find your balance and absorb the movements of the line.\n10. Continue to wave your free arms and legs around to help you balance. Sometimes you will twist and turn your body into all sorts of positions to keep your balance. Once you have caught your balance slowly move your body back to center with your arms up and out, knee(s) bent, head up, and eyes focused on a single point.\n11. Repeat these steps until you can balance for at least 15 seconds.\n12. Practice with the other foot. Once you can keep your balance, attempt taking a step.\n13. Once you've successfully taken your first step, keep practicing!\n\n\n## Sample skill progression for beginners\n\n1. These are small steps you can take to improve your slack lining effectively, by slowly taking on harder and harder tasks. Mount the line on one foot with a friend sitting on the line. Increase the distance between you and the person sitting on the line. Balance on one foot by yourself. Balance on the other foot. Balance with both feet, one behind the other, on the line. Take small steps forward. Take small steps backwards. Mount the line sideways (shoulders parallel to the line) with both feet, one at a time. Turn on the line.\n2. Additionally, learn how to fall safely. As a beginner you will likely be on a short, low-to-the-ground slackline. Most of the time you can land on your feet. As you try new tricks, the slackline can \"throw\" you as you lose your balance. The best solution is to use the \"throw\" of the slackline to help you get away from the line and land on your feet. If you are thrown off-balance from the line consider rolling through the fall to limit the impact.\n3. You can also try starting with \"training wheels.\" One way to do so is to have a friend sit on the line a few feet away from you. This takes much of the sway and bounce out of the line. As you get better, have your friend move further away on the line to allow for more wobble. When starting out, you can aid each other while learning to balance--have a spotter stand/walk next to the line. If you practice walking back and forth with a shoulder to lean on, you’ll soon find that you don’t need training wheels any more!\n"

Is there any physical method for that gas or liquid to pass through that thick heavy metal block (not by drilling etc.)?",
        "output": "Yes, some gases can diffuse into and through metal. It is the bane of the high-vacuum engineer's life. Hydrogen is the worst because it tends to dissociate into atoms at the surface and the nucleus, a single proton, can then leave its electron behind and wander through the metal lattice until it picks up another electron when it leaves.\n\nFor example Mu-metal, favoured for some applications, typically has to be annealed in hydrogen at high temperature. Once that is over, it can take weeks or months for the residual hydrogen to diffuse out of the metal before a high enough vacuum can be achieved and the work proceed.\n\nA &quot;virtual leak&quot; occurs where a small bubble of gas is embedded in the material inside a vacuum chamber. The leak usually happens because a tiny hole exists for the gas to diffuse out through, but sometimes the &quot;hole&quot; is no more than an ultra-thin skin of metal (invisible to the frustrated technician) and the gas diffuses through it. These little horrors can keep going for months or even years and generally mean replacing suspected parts and pumping down over and over again until the dodgy one is finally stumbled on.\n\nHelium is both monatomic and the physically smallest atom. It can diffuse more easily than any other neutral atom or molecule, making certain metal foils unsuitable as say gas-tight liners for airships. As noted in another answer, in quantity it can also affect the bulk properties of the metal.\n\nOn a more energetic scale, hydrogen and helium nuclei (protons and alpha particles) can pass through thin metal foils if fired with sufficient energy, and this has been used to establish the crystalline structures of some metals and alloys (where, for whatever reason, electrons were unsuitable).\n\nOther gases have much larger atoms (neon and other noble gases) or molecules (nitrogen and other diatomic molecules, water and other hydrides), but they can still diffuse extremely slowly through some metals. This can limit the lifetime of some microchips. A related phenomenon occurs where there is a defect in the lattice at the surface, such as a grain boundary, and a gas atom attaches to it. Defects are sometimes quite mobile and can migrate through the lattice; the gas atom will stabilise the defect and may be able to hitch a ride.\n\nQuantum processes such as tunnelling are not really relevant, as they work over distances smaller than the atomic wavelength, which in turn is typically far smaller than the thickness of any metal atom or foil. The probability of a gas atom tunnelling across is so infinitesimal as to be effectively zero."

        "output": "Do you have some old shirts that you no longer wear? Why not turn them into a trendy tube top? If you don't have a t-shirt to spare, get some sewing elastic and stretchy fabric. With a little time and effort, you'll have a bunch of trendy tube tops to wear all summer long.\n\n## Use a shirt\n\n1. Find a t-shirt that that you don't mind cutting up, and turn it inside out. The shirt can be loose or fitted. If the shirt is loose, you will need to insert an elastic to help hold it up. If the shirt if brand new, make sure that its been washed and dried to remove any potential shrinking.\n2. Cut across the top of your shirt, just below the armpits. Try to cut through both layers of the shirt at the same time. This way, you will have to do less cutting. When you are done, discard the top part of the shirt, or save it for another project. If you are having troubles cutting straight, use a ruler or measuring tape as a guideline.\n3. Fold the cut edge down by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) and secure it with sewing pins. Make sure that you are pinning all the way around the top of the shirt; you should still be able to open the shirt, like a tube. For a nice, crisp edge, press the folded hem down with a clothing iron.\n4. Sew along the folded edge, leaving a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) gap in the back. Try to sew as close to the cut edge as you can. You will need the space between the stitching and the folded edge for the elastic. Also, make sure that you leave a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) wide gap between where you started and finished sewing, or you won't be able to get the elastic inside. Try to use a thread color that closely matches your t-shirt. If your sewing machine has a knit fabric setting, try to use that; it usually looks like a standard straight stitch that's broken up by V shapes. Remove the pins when you are done. Also, remember to snip off the loose ends of the threads.\n5. Measure around your chest, just below the armpits, and cut some elastic according to that measurement. This will help hold your tube top up. Even if your shirt was fitted, an elastic might still be a good idea; fitted shirts can loosen over time.\n6. Clip a safety pin to one end of the elastic, and use it to guide the through the top hem of your shirt. Find the ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) wide gap in your stitching. Push the safety pin through it, and use it to guide the elastic all the way around the top of the shirt. When you reach the gap again, pull the safety pin out. Both ends of the elastic should now be sticking out of the gap. Be careful not to lose the other end of the elastic inside the shirt hem.\n7. Sew the two ends of the elastic together. Overlap the two ends by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters), then sew them down using the smallest stitch you can. Overlapping the ends of the elastic like this will prevent any unsightly bulges. When you are done, push the elastic back through the gap. Once you have the elastic back through the gap, you can sew the gap shut for a nicer finish.\n8. Wear your tube top. Be sure to wear a strapless bra with it so that you don't have any bra straps showing.\n\n\n## Make a tube top from scratch\n\n1. Measure around your bust and waist. Add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) to each measurement. You will need this extra width for the seam allowances.\n2. Measure from just below your armpits down to your waist. Add 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) to your measurement. You will need this extra length for the hems.\n3. Choose your fabric, and spread it out in front of you, wrong-side-up. The best fabric to use for a tube top is stretchy, jersey type fabric, like the kind used to make t-shirts.\n4. Draw a large rectangle according to your measurement. The top of the rectangle should equal your bust measurement. The bottom of the rectangle should equal your waist measurement. It will likely taper slightly.\n5. Fold the rectangle in half, lengthwise, with the right sides together. Secure the side edge with sewing pins. Leave the top and bottom edges alone for now. You will hem them later.\n6. Sew along the side edge using a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance. Pull the pins out as you sew so that you don't accidentally prick yourself. When you are done, tie the threads off into tight knots, and snip them as close to the fabric as you can.\n7. Press the seam flat with an iron. Flatten the tube top on your ironing board, with the seam facing upward. Spread the seam allowances apart, so that they lay flat against the fabric to either side of the seam. Press them flat with a hot iron.\n8. Fold the top and bottom of your fabric down by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) to make the hems. Secure the folds with sewing pins, and press them flat with a clothing iron. The wrong sides of the fabric should still be facing outward at this time.\n9. Sew the top and bottom hems, but leave a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) wide gap on the top hem. You will need this gap to slide the elastic through. When sewing the hems, try to sew as close to the raw/cut edge as you can, so that you will have enough space for the elastic. When you are done, pull the sewing pins out. Be sure to tie the ends of the threads off into tight knots and to snip them off, as close to the fabric as you can. Try to use a stitch intended for sewing stretchy fabrics. It usually looks like a straight stitch, but is broken up by V-shapes.\n10. Measure your around chest, just below the armpits and cut a piece of elastic according to that measurement. This piece of elastic will help keep the tube top up, so make sure it is sturdy.\n11. Clip a safety pin to the elastic, and use it to feed the elastic through the top hem. Find that ½ inch (1.27 centimeter) wide gap in the top hem. Push the safety pin into the gap, then use it to feed the elastic through the hem. When you reach the gap again, unclip the safety pin. When you are done, you should have both ends of the elastic sticking out from the gap.\n12. Overlap the ends of the elastic be 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) and sew them down. Use the smallest stitch you can, and be careful not to sew them to the fabric. When you are done, push the elastic back through the gap. At this point, you can sew the gap shut for a neater finish.\n13. Finished.\n"

Packing your bags can be one of the most frantic and stressful aspects of travel–not to mention one that’s often left until the last minute. To slow down this aspect of your traveling, create a packing list months in advance of your trip. Write down travel necessities (clothes, passport, computer) first, and add new items to the list when they come to mind. Don’t throw away your list after you return from your trip. A well-made travel list can serve you for years, since you’ll typically take the same items with you from one trip to the next. Consider laminating your packing list and placing it in your suitcase or backpack, so you won’t have to search for it each time you’re planning a new trip.\n2. Pack well in advance, and travel light. To slow down the speed of your travel preparation and to avoid stress, start packing in advance. Although some items—such as clothes and toiletries—may need to be packed the day before you leave, others can be set aside weeks in advance. This will allow you to pack more slowly, and decrease travel-associated stress. As a busy traveler, it’s also important that you travel light. This will help you move with less stress through busy airports, security lines, and bus terminals. Packing light will also help you focus on the places you’re traveling to see, as you won’t be weighed down by several heavy bags. Only focus on bringing the essentials; you can always pick up incidental objects on your trip.\n3. Consider booking through a travel agent. Especially if you’re planning a long trip—or several short trips—with multiple destinations, hotel stays, rental cars, and other logistics, plan to talk with a travel agent. Although the profession may seem outdated, an agent can put together all of these bookings for you, so that you’re not searching through countless travel websites on your own time. For long, complex trips, working with a travel agent could also save you money. Your travel agent may be able to find lucrative deals that you wouldn’t have access to, or may know ways to package flight, hotel, and rental car purchases together to decrease the cost.\n\n\n## Slow down while you’re travel\n\n1. Let the hotel front desk staff do some of the work. A large part of the headache of fast-paced travel comes from the plethora of details that can consume your time and generate stress. Rather than micro-managing each detail yourself, seek assistance from the front-desk staff or hotel concierge. For example, ask the front desk of your hotel to make you a dinner reservation, call you a cab, or put together an outline of a travel plan for a day. Especially if you’re traveling with children, you’ll need to rely on others around you to make your trip less stressful and busy. Ask the front desk staff for restaurant recommendations, and recommendations of local activities that are fun for children.\n2. Schedule in “required” extra time for delays. As a busy traveler, you’ll often have a tight schedule to keep: flight times, bus schedules, and train timetables may be your first priority. However, delays are an unfortunate but inevitable part of travel. Slow down your travel schedule by allowing extra time around all plane, bus, and train travel, and you’ll find yourself feeling less busy and enjoying your travel time more. By accepting that delays are a part of travel, you can save yourself stress and worry. You can also pan to be productive during your delays—call ahead to alert the hotel that you’ll be arriving late, or if you have a longer delay, walk around a local neighborhood to absorb the culture.\n3. Plan to do fewer activities. This may seem like an intuitive step, but it’s one that many busy travelers forget. Rather than filling your time when you’re traveling with a dozen plans, which will leave you feeling rushed and drained, simplify your trip and only do the three or four activities that you’re most excited about. For example, if a city is known for its world-class art museum but you’d rather spend the day exploring a local forest, don’t feel obliged to do both. Stick with the forest. Filling your time with fewer activities—but ones that are more interesting, pleasurable, and meaningful to you as an individual—will help you slow down your travel pace. This will allow you to savor and enjoy each activity more.\n\n\n## Use slow-paced travel methods\n\n1. Slow down your method of travel by staying on the ground. If you’re used to traveling primarily by plane—a fast-paced, high-stress mode of travel—look into alternate options. For example, a road trip is a great way to see local attractions and parts of a country or region that you haven’t visited before. A road trip also allows you to slow down and travel at your own leisurely pace. If you’ve never traveled by train, it can be an excellent way to slow down the pace of your travel and have more local-color experiences while traveling. Train travel moves at a leisurely pace, and you won’t have to worry about catching connecting flights or navigating unfamiliar—and stressful—airports.\n2. Take a local approach and travel somewhere nearby. You can also slow down the busy pace of your travel by focusing on in-depth exploration of a single local city, town, or region, rather than traveling across the country or world. Treating your own local environment like a travel destination will allow you to absorb local color that you haven’t noticed before, and you’ll be able to avoid the stressful tourist traps that draw inexperienced travelers in new cities and countries. As long as you’re traveling locally, you can try eating locally too. If there’s a farmer’s market open in the area, do your shopping there; you’ll doubtlessly be surprised by the varieties of local food that you’ve never sampled before. You don’t have to stay in your own house to explore a local area. Look into local AirBnBs, traditional Bed and Breakfasts, and “mom and pop”-type hotel: say, within 30 miles of where you live.\n3. Take an affordable cruise. A cruise offers many conveniences that will help you keep your travel slow paced and not too stressful. The cruise ship will offer you a “home base” to start your daily explorations from, so you won’t have to worry about rushing from hotel to hotel, or from AirBnB to AirBnB. Cruise ships tend to travel at a moderate pace, giving their customers plenty of time to explore local cities and sites. The cruise will also confine you to a single region, which is beneficial to a slow-paced, low-stress travel plan. To book a cruise, first check large travel websites, including Expedia and Priceline. You can also book cruises directly through the websites of large providers, such as Carnival and Royal Caribbean Cruise. If you travel with several family members or friends, the cruise line may offer you a group discount. Cruises can be surprisingly inexpensive, especially if booked for the off season.\n"

        "output": "Transitioning to a new school can be difficult for kids in general, as they are trying to figure out who they are, what they like, and how they fit in with their peers. Here are a few ideas for how to help her adjust:\n\n* Talk to her about her feelings. Ask her how she is feeling about the transition. Let her know that it's okay to be sad or upset about leaving her old school and starting at a new one. Let her know that it's okay to feel excited too! \n* Find out what is bothering her, and then help her to find ways to cope. Talking with her teachers may give you some clues, as they may have noticed her acting out in class and can offer suggestions as well.\n* Encourage her to make friends. Remind her that making friends is a skill that can be learned. Talk about ways that she can meet new people, like joining an after-school club or asking a classmate to go to lunch with her. \n* Encourage her to explore her new school. Help her to make a list of the different areas of the school, like the playground, cafeteria, and library. Ask her if she would like to explore the school with you during her lunch break or after school. \n* Encourage her to take responsibility. Try to give her more responsibilities at home. Let her help you to make meals, do the dishes, or fold laundry. Let her know that you trust her to do these things. This will help to build her confidence and sense of responsibility, which will help her to feel more comfortable at school.\n\nThe most important thing that you can do is to let her know that you are there for her if she needs you. Give her some space though, and don't pressure her into opening up if she doesn't want to."

        "instruction": "How to be in a relationship without your parents knowing?",
        "output": "Do you have a relationship you want to hide from your parents? Are your parents unreasonable, abusive, or just a bit too conservative? Whether you’re keeping it a secret because you’re too young or because your parents won’t approve due to their values, hiding your relationship can be challenging. While you could risk losing your parents' trust if they ever find out, you don't want to put yourself in harm's way or compromise your values. Communication, honesty, and trust are essential to any relationship, but sometimes you need to be less than truthful for your own mental and physical health.\n\n## Examine why you should hide your relationship\n\n1. Evaluate your priorities. Decide if it's actually a good idea to keep your relationship with your parents. Do your parents disapprove of your relationship because they are strict, protective or worrisome? Does culture, religion, or an age difference factor into their disapproval? While your parents have the benefit of life experience, only you know what your relationship is worth to you. Talk to your friends and support system. Remember that if you keep your relationship a secret, the greater the potential problems will be when it comes to light. You have a support system to help guide you in the right direction. If you just don't think the relationship is serious enough yet and don't wish your parents to make a big deal of it, some of the following instructions may be excessive. Consider how your parents may feel if you exaggerated the need for secrecy; they may feel disappointed and wonder why don't you trust them. Take risks prevention if you really go ahead. For example, think about what would you do if you are caught by your parents, think about what would you do if your parents know you are owning a separate social media account/secret cell phone that makes use to communicate with your partner, think about what would you do if your dating relationship goes wrong, think about what would you do if you broke up, etc. Consider whether these risks/consequences are affordable. It is recommended to be honest if you are getting caught. Once you get caught, more lies would only make you get into greater trouble, damaging a family relationship. As for dating relationship goes wrong or challenges comes, you will need great mental and physical quality to afford it without any support from your parents.\n2. Communicate with your partner. If you want to pursue your relationship despite knowing that your parents will disapprove, let your partner know why you think that this is the right course of action. Your partner may feel less important and bring resentment to your relationship if you don't clarify your stance. The longer you hide, the more difficult it is going to be. Your partner may have a valid argument if he or she has been through this situation before. For example, just because it is your first interracial relationship, it may not be the first time for your partner. He or she may have practical advice to help you understand where your parents are coming from and, above all else, having her support can help ease your stress. Your partner may also misunderstand the situation. Some people expect to be introduced at the start of a serious relationship, some are cool with waiting, and some do not wish to be introduced for quite some time.\n3. Consider the opinions of your parents. It may be difficult to hear negative opinions about someone you care about, but sometimes your parents may have a better perspective on long-term outcomes. Depending on your dynamic with your parents, they may have trouble articulating their disapproval. Relationships with parents can be complicated. It may be difficult to be open and honest but keep your communication respectful so as not to escalate the situation. For example, while you may think that you are hiding your emotions, you actually may be coming off passive-aggressive or snarky.\n4. Remember all healthy relationships are built on trust, respect, and communication. Whether you are trying to strengthen your relationship with your partner or maintain the relationship with your parents, trust and respect have to be present for a lasting relationship. If you plan on hiding your relationship, ask yourself why sacrificing your parent's trust is the only option. Physical and emotional well-being should not be sacrificed for anyone, including your parents or partner. Will your parents become physically or verbally abusive if they found out about your relationship? Is any aspect of your relationship conflict with your parents’ beliefs? If your parents’ disapproval is based on prejudice or if their reaction is abusive, seek professional help. Your mental and physical health is your first priority.\n\n\n## Overcome overbear parent\n\n1. Be mature. Your parents will always be protective so show them that you are old enough to handle the responsibilities of a relationship. Firstly, show your parents that you are responsible and can follow all the rules. If your parents think you are too young for a relationship, be on time, do your chores, and study. If you can gain your parents' trust, then your parents will soon realize that you are mature enough to handle a relationship.\n2. Understand the risks of premarital sex. Parents often forbid relationships for fear of unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted infection. Ensure that you and your partner truly understand these risks. There is a real possibility that if you are not prepared, and you do have an unwanted pregnancy or contract an STD, your parents may not be there to support you or just can't help you (e.g., they can help you with bringing up a child to some extent, if they wish to do so; they can't cure HIV).You may not agree with your parents rules, but communicate with your partner and respect each other's boundaries to ensure you are both prepared and safe. Know that you should be respected by your significant other and that they should listen to your choices. Compromise is vital in a relationship, but this is one area where neither party should have to compromise their beliefs. Know that if you are eager to take the relationship to another level but your partner isn't ready, you must respect their choice. Never pressure your partner.\n3. Avoid PDA moments. Be discreet about your affection. You never know who is watching. A trusted friend may accidentally tell your parents in passing, not knowing that your relationship is a secret. Stealing kisses in public and other forms of PDA may seem harmless but remember that if your parents find out, they may think that your relationship has already crossed further into the intimacy threshold.\n4. Buy one new cell phone secretly. If it is possible to do so, owning a separate cell phone can help you in concealing information, but please remember that you must hide your new phone properly or you will be in trouble. If you are not able to buy one new phone, you may put a password in your original cell phone and computer if FEASIBLE. However, it is not advised to do so. Putting or changing a password on shared computer/ cell phone may get suspicious, even some parents may ask you to unlock/undo the password set when they check your phone or use the family computer. Delete the messages on your phone when you sleep or leave your phone unattended. It is recommended to delete partly instead of all messages because you may get suspicious if the messaging history is blank. It is best to use Incognito mode on a browser when you are online. Otherwise, erase browsing history after you have been online. However, erasing browsing history may look suspicious if the browser history has never been erased on a shared device, but if you use Incognito mode, you don't need to worry about this. In case your parents check your phone, either don’t put your partner’s number on your phone or use your partner’s nickname or surname instead of his actual first name. It is also possible to use the masculine or feminine form of their name. For example, Brian becomes Brianna and Stephanie becomes Stephen. However, it is best to memorize your partner's contact information in your mind and don't put any of his/her contact information on your phone.\n5. Tell your partner not to post anything on social media sites or send instant messages. If you have a social media account or use other instant messaging apps, your parents could check up on you or hear from someone else with access to your account. Create an alternate account that you can use to be romantic with your partner. This is a handy tool when dealing with long distance relationships.\n6. Have a cover. The trustworthy friends take two jobs: 1)Helping you on hiding the relationship and giving you advice on your relationship. They can support you on hiding the relationship such as collaborate on stories for your parents if you're on a date. Not only those friends can be a great cover-up for phone calls or texts, but they also act as an Intelligence Agency so that you can beat yourself to the punch to take prevention. For instance, you friends find out your parents would go to somewhere on someday, then you should take consideration before you want to meet with your partner. The another job of them is monitoring your relationship. You should acquire a political wisdom: The more voice, you make smarter decision. It is better to have more than one reliable friends so that you can listen to more than one voice if you have lots of resources to do this, even your friends could form a 'House'. However the biggest disadvantage is the larger social group, the greater chance of secret leakage even through they are royal. If your friends has concerns about your partner or refuses to continue being your alibi, heed his/her advice. It’s easy to think that one source is wrong, but if multiple sources are telling you not to continue your relationship, perhaps it’s best to listen to their logic. Using them as an excuse if they don't agree to it is unfair to your friend.\n7. Hide gifts. It is best to hide all the gifts safely. It could be at the outside of your home at your trustworthy friend's home, rent storage, your partner's home, etc. It is strongly advised not to keep the gifts at your home because your parents could find these gifts easily if they are intended and diligent in scanning every corner of your house thoroughly. You're going to draw attention from your parents if you suddenly lock your closet or room. You can also agree to treat each other to lunches or movies rather than giving physical gifts.\n\n\n## Manage collateral\n\n1. Prevent your friends from commenting about your relationship with anyone. Whether it's telling people in passing or posting on each other's social media pages, convey how catastrophic it would be if their innocent comment made its way to your parents. Social media can be especially dangerous because you never know who is connected to whom. Ask your friends politely not to post any incriminating comments or pictures. It may be a wise idea not to let anyone take any pictures when you are in a group setting with your significant other.\n2. Use multiple social media accounts. The great thing about social media is that the larger sites are free. Set up as many accounts as you need to cover your tracks. Remember your password and only log on when using a device not shared with your parents.\n3. Set up a shell email account. Not only would a fake email account be advantageous because your parents won't recognize it, but you should also use it to set up your fake social media account. Remember that your parents can search for you on social media based on your email info.\n4. Adjust your privacy settings on social media. All social media will give you an option to filter what information you share with the public. Go to the Settings Menu and set up your profile so that only you and your partner have access to it. You can also select a few friends to be able to view your profile if you deem them trustworthy. You will have the opportunity to filter your updates and postings so that you can block your parents from seeing. However, the best way to block your parents from seeing is not to post anything damaging at all.\n5. Provide false information when creating shared social media accounts or when together in a public gathering. Remember that your parents can search social media sites via your date of birth, phone number, last name, school, or job. Don't make the mistake of creating a false account without ensuring every detail won't lead back to you. Change your profile name completely. Don't use your middle name, your name spelled backward, or the name of your dog. Anything remotely close to you may end up giving you away in the long run. It's better to exercise extreme caution.\n6. Hide your emotions. If you get into an argument with your partner, try not to show your parents how angry or sad you are. Don't emote in public for it to get back to your parents. Find an outlet to release your emotions. It may be difficult to be unable to share your emotions, so research ways to prevent emotional outbursts. For example, taking up boxing may work to vent frustration while listening to upbeat music in headphones may be enough to cheer you up after an argument with your partner. Only you know how to handle your emotions.\n7. Keep track of what you are telling everyone. If you are lying to a lot of people, it will become difficult to keep track of all the details. Keep your stories consistent and try to keep it as simple as possible. The more details you add, the more difficult it will be to remember them all.\n8. Frame your partner as a platonic relationship. Don't let your parents get suspicious you are hiding a relationship from them by letting them know that you have a platonic relationship with your partner that demands your time. Introduce them openly and talk about them the same as any other platonic relationship in your life. For example, if you introduce them as your coworker, you can talk about work-related issues and meetings and how you and your partner have supported one another through deadlines.\n9. Change your routine. Meet your partner at places that you would not normally go to and that your parents are not aware of. Change your social calendar so that you leave no chance of getting caught by your parents or someone who could tell your parents. Better yet, find out your parents' schedule. Not only will you be able to have peace-of-mind knowing where your parents are but you will also be able to meet your partner as far away from them as you can.\n\n\n## Deal with a difference in age\n\n1. Ask yourself if you feel like yourself around your partner. Your partner should accept you for who you are and your parents may not be able to see beyond the age difference. Once your parents see that your relationship is healthy and that you are a better person for it, it will be easier for them to see beyond the age gap.\n2. Keep perspective. It’s easy to get swept up in the allure of dating someone older or younger than you. Look ahead and see if the age difference will affect you in any way. Your parents may be fearful that the age gap may widen as your relationship continues. A difference in age may be more of a big deal if you are younger. Your parents may be fearful that you are growing up too soon or that an older partner is taking advantage of you. A big age gap if you're a minor and your partner isn't may also be illegal. Take their perspective into account when continuing your relationship.\n3. Understand any power dynamics. If your partner is your professor or boss, it’s prudent to know the rules. Your parents may rest easier knowing that everyone is protected from any legal actions. Understand that being in a teacher-pupil relationship can get the teacher fired and, depending on your age, even jailed. This is one relationship that is better to be put on hold - for both of you. If you truly love each other, you can wait until both of you are adults, and you have graduated.\n\n\n## Deal with your parents’ different value\n\n1. Surround yourself with supportive people. If you must hide your relationship because of a difference in values -- whether religious or cultural -- seek the help of people who have been in similar situations. Bide time to help your parents and/or partner adjust to the situation. By surrounding yourself with caring and respectful people, you can rise above your parents’ closed-mindedness if they are unwilling to change.\n2. Support your partner. Assure your partner that they are cared for and that you don’t agree with your parents but don’t want to lose your relationship with them. Build his confidence that your parents' opinions won’t hurt your relationship. Let him know that he is more important than your parent’s approval and that the secrecy is temporary. You don’t need to put a time limit, but it can be expected that your partner may give you an ultimatum. No one wants to be in a relationship that their partner is ashamed to be in. Be prepared to choose between telling your parents or losing your partner.\n3. Don’t take a side. This isn’t about who is right or wrong, this is about how you define family and your own values. Everyone will have to learn to respect and accept one another if you want to have them in your life. Be strong in your own values and communicate respectfully that you are unwilling to compromise that. Hiding your relationship should not be permanent. It may take time for your parents to realize that only you know what’s best for you. If it means losing your parents, that is for them to decide. Being true to yourself is what's most important for your mental, emotional and physical health.\n"

        "instruction": "Did two dissenting Supreme Court justices agree that Trump was \"absolutely immune\" to the Manhattan DA's subpoena?",
        "output": "If you are interested in the gory details, please see the full decision in Trump v. Vance. The first half of the linked document contains the Court's majority opinion and the concurring opinion of Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch, followed by the separate dissenting opinions of Justices Thomas and Alito.\nBased on a quick read, it's apparent that Justice Thomas agrees with the general court's opinion that a sitting President &quot;is not entitled to absolute immunity from issuance of [a] subpoena&quot;. Thomas dissents on the grounds that the President &quot;may be entitled to relief against [a subpoena's] enforcement&quot; based on his special status as president. Thomas argues (agreeing with the president) that the case should be vacated and returned to the lower court, so that the President can argue that his duties to the nation take up all of his time and attention and he thus deserves relief from the subpoena.\nJustice Alito makes a stronger dissent. While he agrees that a sitting President is not absolutely immune from a state subpoena, he argues that such a subpoena should not be enforced unless it meets a stringent legal test, such that:\n\n* It does not interfere with the President's execution of his duties of office, and\n* It carries a weight of urgency — e.g., subpoenaing information related to suspected treason — as a guarantee it is not merely issued to harass.\n\nIn the absence of those conditions, in Alito's opinion, the President is only subject to the constitutional process of impeachment and trial in Congress.\nSo no, neither dissenting Justice suggests that the President is absolutely immune from this kind of subpoena. Instead, they are concerned that the issuance of such subpoenas might negatively impact on the President's ability to perform the duties of the office, and argue that the President might legitimately be granted varying degrees of relief from such legal actions at a court's discretion."

A deep treatment is a great way to improve dry or damaged hair because it moisturizes and strengthens the hair. Read on to learn how to apply one!\n\n## Basic deep treatment\n\n1. Obtain the deep treatment. You can buy one from a store or make your own see below for recipes in \"Related wikiHows\" that you can make at home.\n2. Wash your hair. The hair should be freshly washed before applying the treatment so it can soak in properly. Don't wait until your hair dries to apply the treatment.\n3. Apply the deep treatment to your whole head of hair. Use a comb or brush to distribute the product.\n4. Put your hair up in a towel turban, shower cap, heating cap, etc. This will keep the deep treatment on your hair, and not on your clothes.\n5. Wait for 15 minutes to an hour. Or you can sleep while wearing the deep treatment.\n6. Take the cap off, rinse your hair, and style as usual.\n7. Enjoy your soft, moisturized hair!\n\n\n## Avocado mask deep treatment\n\n1. Get your ingredients. For your deep conditioning mask, you'll need 1 egg-white, 1 avocado, a tablespoon of olive oil, and a tablespoon of honey. These measurements can be altered depending on how long and thick you hair is.\n2. Mix the ingredients. Using a blender or food processor, add all your ingredients and blend them on high until a creamy consistency has formed. If you don't have a blender, you can mash the ingredients together manually, but it will take a bit more time.\n3. Apply the mixture to your hair. Scoop some of the mask onto your fingertips, and spread it throughout your hair, focusing primarily on the ends of each strand. When you've used all of the mask, you can wrap your hair up in a shower-cap to prevent the mask from rubbing off on your clothes.\n4. Let the mask set. Leave the mask for 20-30 minutes to allow time for it to soak into your hair. You can leave it on for longer if you would like, but make sure that you wait at least 20 minutes.\n5. Rinse out the mask. Remove your shower-cap and run your hair under warm water in the shower. Using just the warm water, wash out all of the remaining mask. If you need to, you can use shampoo, but try to avoid it because it will dry out your hair again. When you're finished washing your hair out, dry your hair with a towel.\n6. Repeat the process. You can apply this mask to your hair 1-2 times a week for the optimal results. Otherwise, apply this avocado mask to your hair whenever it starts to appear dull, frizzy, or is dry and damaged to the touch.\n"

        "instruction": "I did my training around the Seattle area, and was told that landing at SeaTac Airport (the region's major International/Commercial airport), while not strictly forbidden, was definitely frowned upon because it can slow down and interfere with the big planes on schedules. To discourage GA aircraft from using the big airport, they have a variety of landing fees, ramp fees, and prior-approval requirements.\nBut later, I moved near MCI, and was told that landing at the big airport was no big deal.  That they're actually happy to have little planes there.\nIf you fly small GA planes, do you land at the major airports in your area?\nWhat advanced preparations can you make to minimize your impact on the \"big boys\", and remain a good airspace citizen?",
        "output": "Can you? Absolutely, and air traffic control will treat you (almost) like any other airplane. You are supposedly handled on a first-come-first-serve basis (reality is slightly different with different aircraft speeds, etc.). Do the airlines like it if you slow them down?  No, but it's part of the system and the way that it works.\n\nVery often, there are multiple runways at bigger airports, and sometimes there are even shorter runways that are dedicated for airplanes that don't need to land on the same one as the \"big boys\". Even if not, they will work you in.\n\nNow, that being said, very often there is a better option. As you said, there are usually high fees at the big airports, so landing at a smaller satellite airport can often save you money and save you time because you won't have to taxi as far or sit and wait in line to get out. An extra 15 minutes by car can be better than an extra 30 minutes while taxiing. \n\nAs far as being prepared, it isn't really much different than smaller airports other than the fact that ATC is much busier. They don't have the time/tolerance to keep repeating instructions to you, and expect you to be \"on your game\". When they rattle off taxi instructions like \"Cessna N1234, taxi to the ramp via Alpha, Tango, Echo, and Xray. Hold short of runway 23.\" they expect a quick readback and for you to follow instructions exactly because they need to move on to the next guy. \n\nIt will also help everyone out if you don't fly your final approach the way that most people are taught for an entire 10 mile final: very close to your actual landing speed. In fact, you are usually landing on a runway that is 4X+ the distance that you need and you can slow down fairly quickly (especially compared to a jet), so if you can fly an extra 20 (or 80) knots as long as possible, it will be greatly appreciated and keep traffic moving. Make sure that you leave yourself enough time to slow down at the end and above all else, ***be safe***."

        "output": "It is extremely important.\nWhat is more important though is to understand that multithreading is just one way to solve the asynchrony problem. The technical environment in which many people are now writing software differs from the historical software development environment (of monolithic applications performing batch computations) in two key ways:\n\n* Many-core machines are now common. We can no longer expect clock speeds or transistor densities to increase by orders of magnitude. The price of computation will continue to fall, but it will fall because of lots of parallelism. We're going to have to find a way to take advantage of that power.\n* Computers are now heavily networked and modern applications rely upon being able to fetch rich information from a variety of sources.\n\nFrom a computational standpoint, these two factors essentially boil down to the same core idea: information increasingly will be available in an asynchronous fashion. Whether the information you need is being computed on another chip in your machine or on a chip halfway around the world doesn't really matter. Either way, your processor is sitting there burning billions of cycles a second waiting for information when it could be doing useful work. \nSo what matters now, and what will matter even more in the future, is not multithreading per se, but rather, dealing with asynchrony. Multithreading is just one way to do that -- a complicated, error-prone way that is only going to get more complicated and more error-prone as weak-memory-model chips become more widely used. \nThe challenge for tools vendors is to come up with some way better than multithreading for our customers to deal with the asynchronous infrastructure they'll be using in the future."

        "instruction": "How to repair your damaged reputation at work?",
        "output": "People make mistakes. Sometimes these mistakes are bad enough to cost us the respect of those around us or even our jobs. If you’ve made a bad professional error or hurt colleagues at work, though, the damage might not be permanent. You can put the past behind you, but you’ll have to work hard to rebuild relationships, become a model worker, and, in some cases, manage your reputation online.\n\n## Rebuild relationships\n\n1. Admit your mistake. If you’ve damaged your reputation – wronging a coworker, angering your boss, or just getting an overall bad name – the place to start is to own up to it. Admit the error of your ways. Take stock of your actions and accept responsibility for them, to yourself and in front of others. What happened? Where did you go wrong? Be brutally honest with yourself. For example, do you have bad personal habits? Did you try to cut corners and dodge work? Have you been an office gossip? Or, did you have a serious lapse of judgement? Perhaps you stole someone’s idea and got caught or plagiarized a report. Perhaps you just stole, embezzling money.\n2. Apologize. Even if you don’t have a future at your workplace, you should apologize to the people you’ve hurt. Showing remorse is decent and will help you start to redeem yourself. You will not get very far with building bridges and repairing your reputation if you can’t say sorry. Act as soon as you can. The longer you wait to apologize, the more it seems like you aren’t really that sorry. Don’t make excuses. The point is to show remorse and accept that you were wrong. Don’t insert half-excuses or mealy-mouth language into your apology, for example “I’m sorry if you were offended that I took your idea. I only wanted to improve it.”\n\t* Be humble and own up. For instance, “It was really wrong of me to talk behind your back. I know I’ve hurt you and want to ask for your forgiveness.”\n\t* Be sincere. You won’t get credit if you don’t say specifically what you did. You also won’t credit if you don’t say it apologetically and sincerely, showing that you won't repeat the behavior.\n3. Commit to reform. Besides an apology, write out a plan for how you’ll change and ensure your mistake doesn’t happen again. This can be for you alone or, if you’re lucky to keep your job, to share with the powers that be in the organization. Outline what you did wrong and how you will avoid it. For example, “I made the mistake of getting too involved in workplace gossip and ended up saying harmful things about my coworkers. From now on, I plan to keep my head down, mind my own business, and avoid office politics.”\n\t* Don’t forget to “walk the walk” and follow your plan. You might arrange regular check-ins with your boss, for instance, to discuss your behavior. This will highlight your progress as well as show that you are willing and able to reform.\n4. Keep your attitude in check. Repairing your reputation is going to be a humbling experience. You might feel angry or resentful. You might get annoyed, frustrated, or upset. Keep these emotions under control – you’ve had a bad attitude in the past and need others to see that you’re trying to change. Try to stay calm, collected, and positive. Be aware of the attitudes or emotions that added to your bad behavior in the past. Try to avoid them or situations that bring them out. If your problem is gossip, avoid the office gossipers as best you can. Stop and ask yourself throughout the day, “How’s my attitude? Am I positive? Am I productive?” Catch any problems early and try to readjust your mindset.\n\n\n## Become a model employee\n\n1. Get to work early. Apart from apologies and repairing relationships, set yourself up as a model employee to help you rebuild your work reputation. Be a go-getter. Arrive early and ready to impress. People will eventually start to notice. Getting to work early will make a good impression on your boss and perhaps your coworkers. Often, people aren’t around to see who leaves the office last. But they will notice your presence in the morning. Being early also means you don’t have to rush around. Use the quiet time to your advantage and plan out your day. It doesn’t hurt to take a short walk around the office first thing in the morning. People will see you and take note.\n2. Prioritize. Some people have trouble keeping track of what they need to do during a given day or week. Take initiative and prioritize your work. Keep your nose to the grindstone to avoid returning to past mistakes and to present yourself as great employee. For instance, sit down and write out what you need to do for each day or, longer term, each week and month. If you’ve been coming to work early, use that time to set out daily priorities. Having a to-do list will help you focus your energy. You might also tailor the list to take advantage of your peak work hours. For instance, if you do your best work in the morning, save that time for your top priorities. Try to stick to the list. That said, be flexible in case your boss gives you special instructions.\n3. Do your tasks thoroughly and on-time. Writing down your tasks isn’t all, of course. You actually need to follow through and do them well. Good work and dependability can make a past mistake fade over time. Build up a track record for reliability and your colleagues and boss will have more trust in you in the future. Meet your deadlines. What about that report that’s due next week? Prioritize it in your list on Monday. If you still can’t get it done during the week, consider finishing it at home or over the weekend rather than asking for more time. Be productive, especially if you have had consistency problems before. Take a short breather to stretch or use the restroom, but don’t try to skirt work.\n4. Go above and beyond. Handing in finished work on time is good. To be a model employee, though, you will have to aim even higher and win (or win back) your boss’ trust. Track details, anticipate tasks, and work ahead to further develop a good reputation. If a colleague asks you to think of venues for an upcoming tradeshow, for example, don’t just stop at a list. Take the next steps: call them, ask about availability, and compare prices. When you take initiative like this, you’ll seem smart and like the logical go-to person for key projects.\n\n\n## Repair your reputation online\n\n1. Check your online metrics. If your error was very serious, or if you are well-known and hold a big position, you might want to think about your online presence when rebuilding your reputation. Don’t underestimate negative online info. To start, you will need to take stock of the situation. You can get a quick sense of your online reputation by checking Google’s autocomplete. Just go to the Google homepage. What appears when you type in your name, or your company name? When you enter your name, for example, do you get something positive or neutral like “Harold Bing Brew Co. CEO” and “Harold Bing business award”? Or is it damaging, like “Harold Bing mugshot”? Look at online news stories or reviews about you or your company, if applicable. Check local sites or other social media. Set up a Google Alert in your name, so that you’ll be notified any time something new is posted.\n2. Deal with Google defamation. Programs like Google Suggest reflect real internet searches and should give you an idea of how people associate your name and reputation online. Did you find something unwelcome in your results? There are some things you can do. Do not try to manipulate the results. While some people suggest this approach, using techniques like crowdsourcing, you might end up causing more damage. You might try acquiring the search term and building an optimized page to tell your viewpoint. That way, when someone types “Juliette Page embezzler” she is directed to your side of the story – that the charge is false, misunderstood, or not reported right. You can also request that the search engine take down the autocomplete. This is hard and usually only works with results that suggest hate or violence, porn, or personal information. Still, it may be worthwhile to try.\n3. Hire an online reputation manager. Your online reputation could get out of control. Don’t despair, however. There are people and agencies who can help you manage this kind of situation, like Reputation.com or BrandYourself.com. The work will be pricy, but it may just salvage your working reputation. Reputation managers won’t always be able to get rid of negative content from the web. But they should be able to highlight positives about you. For example, their services might include setting up a domain in your name for a page presenting your side of the story. They can also respond to negative comments or reviews and manage your online presence on sites like Facebook, Twitter, or Youtube. The goal is not to eliminate all negative info about you, but to tip the balance in your favor whenever someone searches for you online. Keep in mind that management services don’t come cheap. Expect to pay between $20 to $200 per month.\n"

For similar reasons, Bhutan was one of the last countries to introduce television in 1999, and has no traffic lights to this day.\n\n*  There are currently few territories on Earth that are unclaimed by any sovereign state (terra nullius). One example is Bir Tawil, along the border between Egypt and Sudan, which was created by a discrepancy between borders drawn in 1899 and 1902. The territory remains unclaimed by either country, because it would entail forfeiting the much larger Halaib Triangle, which is claimed by both countries. Bir Tawil has no settled population, but the land is used by Bedouins who roam the area.\n\n*  The antipode of any spot on Earth is the point on Earth's surface diametrically opposite to it. Some interesting approximate antipodes include pairs of capital cities, such as Wellington (New Zealand) - Mardrid (Spain), and Phnom Penh (Cambodia) - Lima (Peru)."

        "instruction": "How to be cool in college?",
        "output": "Congratulations, you’re in college! If you feel anxious at all about college life, know that you are not alone. To gain instant respect from your fellow classmates and friends, remember to always be yourself. Being friendly and acting confidently are also ways you can earn some cool points among your friends and classmates.\n\n## Reinvent yourself in college\n\n1. List the things you want to change about yourself. Grab a sheet of paper and draw a line down the middle. List the things that you would like to change about yourself in the left column. In the right column write down why you would like to change these things. If after asking why you see that making these changes leads to a better you, then change it. For example, wanting to be less critical of others, or more focused in class are positive changes.\n2. Try something new. College is all about exploring new things and ideas, so be adventurous. When you get the invite to go eat at an exotic restaurant, take it. Studying abroad for one year is another great way to expand your horizons. Try changing your hair color, or style your hair differently. You could also learn a new language, or take a class outside of your major.\n3. Remember to be yourself. It is possible to re-invent yourself without changing your true self. Don't throw out your morals and values just to be considered cool. If the change takes too much effort or requires you to be someone else, then it probably isn't a good change. Stick to changes that produce positive results. If you want to be more outgoing, then be more outgoing on your own terms. Don't start drinking or smoking just to be more outgoing, for example.\n\n\n## Boost your confidence\n\n1. Make a list of your strengths. Also make a list of the things that you like about yourself. Tape the list to your bedroom wall or bathroom mirror. Every morning, read the list to remind yourself of how great you are.\n2. Reverse negative thoughts. If you find yourself thinking that you aren't good enough for college or that no one will want to be friends with you, then reverse these thoughts. Instead, tell yourself, \"I am good enough for college,\" or \"Many people would love to be friends with me because I am a great friend.\"\n3. Do the things that make you feel confident. If wearing makeup helps you feel more confident, then wear makeup. If smiling and greeting your classmates makes you feel more confident, then greet them. If joining a club or volunteering helps you feel more confident, then join a club or volunteer. By doing the things that help you feel more confident, you will be more confident.\n4. Realize that you are not alone. New people and places can make you feel alone and unsure at times. However, understand that you aren't the only one who feels this way. Try to reach out and befriend other classmates, or call your high school friends if you need someone to talk to. If you cannot seem to shake your loneliness, make an appointment with a counselor on campus. A counselor can help you work through hard times.\n\n\n## Be social\n\n1. Portray a friendly attitude. Smile and say hi to your classmates sitting next you. Strike up a conversation by asking them what their major is or what they think about the class. Offering help, like showing someone where the admissions office is, is also a great way to become known as a friendly, down-to-earth person in college. You could also offer to trade notes with someone, or help someone study for a big test.\n2. Be accepting those who are different from you. A typical college has at least 20,000 students, (smaller colleges and community colleges might have anywhere from 2,000-10,000 students) so you are bound to run into someone whose background is completely different from yours. Instead of shying away from them, be curious about who they are. Invite them to lunch or a party to get to know them better.\n3. Attend a football game (or any other sporting event). Tailgating with friends and attending a football game (or any other sporting event) afterward is a college pastime you won’t want to pass up. Go to as many of these as you can, especially if you enjoy them. It is a great way to connect with new people and cultivate friendships. Ask a classmate if they would like to go to a game, or make plans with your roommate to attend a game.\n4. Join a club on campus. If football games or Greek life isn’t your thing, try looking into different clubs on campus. Like sororities and fraternities, they typically host events in the beginning of the year to recruit new members. Attend some of these and join your favorite ones. There are so many clubs in college, the hardest part will be picking one. You can also start a club as well.\n5. Host a party. Hosting a party will definitely shoot you up to the top of the cool list. Have a potluck, plan an outdoor party at a nearby park, or reserve a party room at your college’s game center. Invite your friends, roommates, and acquaintances from class. You could also have a small party in your dorm room, if it is allowed. To ensure your party’s success, make sure to provide some snacks and beverages, cool tunes, and games.\n\n\n## Dress for college\n\n1. Put yourself together before class. Before going to class, make sure to brush your teeth and comb your hair. Also shower if you need to. By taking the time to groom yourself before class, you can give your classmates and professors a good impression of yourself.\n2. Choose sneakers over heels. Going from class to class requires a lot of walking. By wearing sneakers, you can ensure that your feet will be as comfortable as possible. . Some classes will require you to wear certain footwear for practical or safety reasons, especially if you are in some hands-on classes or a PE class. Your instructor/professor will inform you in the syllabus.\n3. Carry a jacket with you. Unlike high school, colleges usually don't have locker areas so you will be wearing or carrying a jacket during the winter season in colder climates. Classroom temperatures typically run very cold to sometimes very hot. Since it is hard to concentrate in class if you are cold, make sure to bring a jacket or a sweater with you. This way you can ensure that you will be comfortable and attentive in class.. People will be paying more attention to your outerwear as part of your look in college than in high school; so, make sure the outerwear you choose matches your preferred look.\n4. Dress with style. Arrive to class in an outfit that makes you feel comfortable, but also one that sends a message of sophistication and style. If casual athletic gear is your style, then wear that. If a cute dress or skirt makes you feel confident, then wear it.\n"

        "instruction": "I don't really get the difference between gain and volume boost.\n\nSo if I understand correctly, gain directly boosts a signal from a line or input while volume handles the output. Volume isn't really for boosting either.\nWould this mean, in most settings, getting 'close to' as much gain as possible without any hiss/background noise is ideal?",
        "output": "Here's a brief overview to get you started. Hopefully this helps!\n\n* 'Gain' controls are typically used to get a good input level. So for example if you had a microphone with a very low output signal, you would boost the gain to get a better level into your mixing desk or audio interface. If you had a synthesizer plugged in you might need to turn the gain down to stop the signal distorting. Gain controls are often controlling an amplifier behind the scenes - i.e. your signal can 'gain' strength after going through the gain stage of your audio equipment. So gain is usually the first control in the signal path of your recording equipment. \n\n* 'Volume' controls on the other hand tend to be at the end of the signal chain and are more likely to be attenuating rather than amplifying the signal. So on a mixing desk, having got a good level from each input at the gain stage, you use the volume faders to adjust the relative volumes of each channel to achieve a good mix. You are not typically amplifying those signals any more though.\n\nA guitar amp is a good example of how this works. The first control is often called \"Gain\" or 'drive' and guitarists often deliberately turn this really high to get a nice distorted sound from a tube preamp. However, the final control is called Volume and governs simply how loud the sound coming out of your speaker is. With gain right up and volume low you can play distorted sounds without annoying the neighbours. With gain low and volume high you get a loud sound but no distortion."

If you can keep the same hypotheses, but add more information to the conclusion, then you have also produced a more \"powerful\" result.\n\nHere is an easy example from Geometry.\n\n  Let $ABCD$ be a (non-square) rectangle.  Then the internal angle bisectors of the vertices intersect at four points $WXYZ$, which are the vertices of a rectangle.\n\n(You need the condition that $ABCD$ is not a square because if it is a square then all four angle bisectors coincide at a single point.)\nHere are a few ways to strengthen the theorem:\n\n* The hypothesis \"$ABCD$ is a (non-square) rectangle\" can be relaxed to the more general \"$ABCD$ is a (non-rhombic) parallelogram\".  The conclusion that $WXYZ$ is a rectangle still holds.\n* Alternatively, you can keep the original hypothesis that $ABCD$ is a (non-square) rectangle, and strengthen to the conclusion to say that $WXYZ$ is not just a rectangle, but a square.\n* Having done that, you can then strengthen the conclusion of the theorem even more, by noting that the diagonal of square $WXYZ$ is equal in length to the difference of the lengths of the sides of $ABCD$.\n* Once you know that, you can now strengthen the theorem even more by (finally) removing the hypothesis that $ABCD$ is non-square, and including the  case in which the four angle bisectors coincide at a single point as forming a \"degenerate\" square with a diagonal of length zero.\n"

        "output": "## TL;DR\nThey belong to the same family of solvers, where sphere tracing is one method of ray marching, which is the family name.\n\n## Raymarching a definition\nRaymarching is a technique a bit like traditional raytracing where the surface function is not easy to solve (or impossible without numeric iterative methods). In raytracing you just look up the ray intersection, whereas in ray marching you march forward (or back and forth) until you find the intersection, have enough samples or whatever it is your trying to solve. Try to think of it like a newton-raphson method for surface finding, or summing for integrating a varying function.\n\nThis can be useful if you:\n\n* Need to render volumetrics that arenot uniform\n* Rendering implicit functions, fractals\n* Rendering other kinds of parametric surfaces where intersection is not known ahead of time, like paralax mapping\netc.\n\n\n## Sphere tracing\nSphere tracing is one possible Ray marching algorithm. Not all raymarching uses benefit form this method, as they can not be converted into this kind of scheme.\n\nSphere tracing is used for rendering implicit surfaces. Implicit surfaces are formed at some level of a continuous function. In essence solving the equation\n```F(X,Y,Z) = 0\n```\n\nBecause of how this function can be solved at each point, one can go ahead and estimate the biggest possible sphere that can fit the current march step (or if not exactly reasonably safely). You then know that next march distance is at least this big. This way you can have adaptive ray marching steps speeding up the process."

        "instruction": "How to make the most of your physical therapy?",
        "output": "## Physical therapy payments\n\n1. Ask your doctor to recommend the best physical therapist for your condition. Many people have to decide based on who their insurance will cover; however, some physical therapists specialize in certain conditions and can offer expertise that an insurance-covered physical therapist cannot. Choose based on what you can afford and how important your timely recovery is.\n2. Call your insurance to ask how many visits are covered. Many insurance plans have caps on physical therapy treatments, from 10 to 35. After severe injuries, you may be able to apply to the insurance company for more treatments, if they are absolutely necessary.\n3. Ask the physical therapy office if you can have a discounted rate, if you are paying out of pocket. Insurance companies often get a discounted rate, so they may afford you the same price. Ask the physical therapist directly, rather than the secretary, because it is the physical therapist that is agreeing to alter their wages.\n\n\n## Physical therapy sessions\n\n1. Have a positive attitude toward physical therapy. Will power and optimism during a recovery are almost as important as doctor's care. Your commitment to the exercises will have a direct correlation to the swiftness and completeness of your recovery.\n2. Wear athletic shoes and loose-fitting, flexible clothing to all physical therapy sessions. If you have to go to your session straight from work, then keep spare exercise clothing in your bag or car. This type of clothing allows you the full range of motion in your exercises and keeps your regular clothes clear of analgesic creams or massage oils.\n3. Drink plenty of water while you are exercising. Although this is a general rule, it is even more important when you are healing from an injury. Stay hydrated throughout the day and bring a water bottle to your session.\n4. Show up early to each appointment. Your physical therapist may allow you to warm up before the session, on a machine or by stretching. This also makes certain that you are never late, because you will be charged for the session from the moment your appointment time arrives. Make sure to be 15 minutes early for your first appointment. You will need to fill out insurance and health forms. Bring a list of your medications and other current treatments.\n5. Discuss your goals with your physical therapist at your first meeting. Pain and injury are different for everyone, so you must make it clear whether you want to return to work, get rid of pain, walk without weight supports or run a marathon. Tell the physical therapist how many sessions you can afford, so the plan can be adjusted for what you will do during your sessions and what you can continue at home. Remember that this may need to be adjusted on the future, based on your progress. In most cases, the harder you work doing prescribed exercises at home, the fewer office sessions you will need to have.\n6. Ask your physical therapist to give you a list of prescribed exercises, with diagrams. They should establish what and when you should be doing each exercise, so that you are clear about your \"homework.\" Ask the physical therapist to show you each exercise as well as having you do repetitions in the office.\n7. Tell your physical therapist whenever something is painful. Mistakes can be made if you do not communicate properly about your pain levels. The physical therapist can also tell you what pain is natural to the healing process and what is unnatural, allowing the exercises to be adjusted.\n8. Ask to be treated by the same physical therapist every time. This provides consistency, familiarity and a greater chance that you will be able to accomplish your goals.\n9. Ask plenty of questions. You must be proactive about your treatment. If you don't understand why you are doing something or how you should do something, you are more likely to refrain from the exercise and fail to progress.\n10. Report your progress at the beginning of each physical therapy session. Make sure you tell your therapist any new pain or problems, as well as your positive progress. They will usually write this on your chart to ensure you won't have complications from the regime.\n11. Leave your cell phone and personal problems at the door when you go to physical therapy. You must use this valuable time to focus on health and your body. You may need to learn to recognize your body's warning signs, which is hard to do when you are distracted.\n\n\n## Physical therapy at home\n\n1. Create a schedule to do your physical therapy exercises at home. Do not leave it up to chance whether you have the time or not. They are as important as doctor-prescribed medicine and should be treated as a priority during your day.\n2. Set aside a space to do physical therapy. Keep a corner of your home ready with a yoga mat or exercise ball, so that you can do a few repetitions when you have some free time. This will help you get into the mentality of exercise as a lifestyle choice.\n3. Take the prescribed therapy exercises seriously. If you are advised to do them once per day, do them every day, and if you are asked to do them 3 times per day, do them 3 times per day. Frequent exercises are usually prescribed when there is a limited time for you to regain your mobility during the healing process, and they should be treated with gravity.\n4. Progress to more repetitions or sets as you get stronger. Many physical therapists will tell you to add 5 repetitions or 1 more set when the exercise becomes easy. You may also be asked to add more weight to your exercises.\n5. Ask the physical therapist for an appropriate regimen to continue after you no longer attend sessions. They should be able to adjust an exercise regime according to your particular health problems. Establish goals that you should reach 3 months, 6 months and a year into the future.\n"

That means there are 27000 watts at work for a short time.\nA 27000 watt lightbulb (BTW, your flash is much brighter than that - more efficient!) would need the ampacity of around eight european household sockets (230V, fused at 13 or 16 amps) to operate, since it would draw around 120 ampere from them. At the voltage levels xenon flash tubes typically operate at, around 80 amperes will flow; if you wanted to pull that energy \"live\" from a 5-6V battery, you'd need to pull around 5000 amperes AND instantaneously convert them to around 80 amperes at high voltage. Batteries that could deliver 5000 amps - while not wasting most of the power as heat generated across their internal resistance - for a short duration and live certainly exist - you are looking at starter batteries for big lorries, which are rather inconvenient to lug around. Also, a 5000 ampere current pulse is quite a magnetic nuisance if there is anything either ferromagnetic or intended as an electrical conductor near the conductors used.\nYour average \"big\" speedlite, btw, will be around half the power described here (but might in some cases reach the same or higher peak currents in order to discharge even faster), an in-camera flash will be a fraction of these numbers - but still inconvenient to build any other way.\nIf you need a short, massive current pulse, the best energy source available in engineering is a previously charged capacitor (metal-paper or electrolytic type, not dual-layer \"supercap\"). This energy storage device is large for its storage capacity if you compare it to a battery - but able to respond far quicker to high current demand, since a) there is no chemical energy conversion involved in its operation, b) the relevant current path only involves metallic, very conductive parts instead of ionic conductors (aka electrolytes. An electrolytic capacitor, btw, does use its electrolyte for chemical self-upkeep, not for chemical energy storage or electrical connectivity). \nAlso, since the charge in a a capacitor is limited, it allows portioning total energy to what the flashlamp can safely take. This allows a flash in manual mode to just completely discharge the capacitor until it is nearly empty (when the remaining charge can only deliver voltage below the quench voltage of the flashlamp) without complex control circuitry - and at the same time gives you a safety fallback when working with dynamically controlled power levels (telecomputer or TTL mode), leaving no way for catastrophic circuit failure in combination with several kilowatts of constant power available turning into a massive safety hazard. A handheld-sized efficient electrical near point light source with 27000W input, driven constantly, would first severely damage your eyes and then self destroy violently (think of a welding arc - dangerously bright, and it melts metal)."

When using loose equality, if one of the operands is of a different type than the other, the engine will attempt to convert one to the other. In the case of an object on the left and a number on the right, it will attempt to convert the object to a number by first calling ```valueOf``` if it is callable, and failing that, it will call ```toString```. I used ```toString``` in this case simply because it's what came to mind, ```valueOf``` would make more sense.

Why can't you hear a whisper in a noisy room?  The noise of the crowd obscures the whisper. The difference between the signal you're trying to pick up and the background noise is called the signal-to-noise ratio.

If your four-legged friend is suffering from the problem, supplements and medications can provide some relief from painful inflammation. Making lifestyle changes, like light exercise and farrier work, can also increase your horse’s comfort and quality of life. Since arthritis is almost impossible to stop, it is important to keep in touch with a veterinarian for advice on continued treatment.\n\n## Make lifestyle change\n\n1. Consult your veterinarian. A vet will need to examine your horse and assess the factors that might be contributing to its arthritis, including age, diet, and activity level. This will help them determine the right medication and lifestyle changes to prescribe your horse. Your vet may take x-rays to assess the severity of your horse’s arthritis and make further suggestions for treatment.\n2. Control the horse’s weight. If your horse is overweight, this will put additional strain on its joints, worsening pain and discomfort. Help your horse lower its weight, if necessary, then feed it a nutritious but lean diet to keep its weight down. Keeping an older horse nourished can be difficult because their nutritional needs and ability to digest food may change. Always ask your vet for advice before making major changes in your horse’s diet.\n3. Don’t keep your horse confined to the stable. Arthritic horses will probably be reluctant or unable to move like they once did. Keeping them indoors, however, will actually make the problem worse. Provide a large pasture for them to roam and graze about to keep the joints moving and prevent the horse from getting too stiff.Regular light exercise, such as trail riding, will be good for your horse, and limit the effects of arthritis.\n4. Talk to your farrier. The condition of a horse’s hooves and shoes are critical to its movement and comfort, and this is especially the case for one suffering from arthritis. Let your farrier know that the horse is having problems with arthritis, and they may make recommendations that will keep its hooves in good condition and make it more comfortable.\n\n\n## Try supplement and medications\n\n1. Give your horse feed supplements. A number of nutritional supplements are available, including glucosamine and hyaluronic acid. These can be given to your horse along with its food to help alleviate some of the symptoms of arthritis, like pain and stiffness. Look for feed supplements at a supply store, or ask your vet. Feed supplements are a simple option to try at first. However, they are not regulated, and they are not guaranteed to be effective. Ask your vet what they recommend for your horse based on the severity of your horse's issues\n2. Try injectable joint products. Some products, including polysulfated glycosaminoglycans (Adequan) and sodium hyaluronate (Legend) can be injected directly into the affected joint to give your horse some relief. A vet may also recommend injecting the joint with steroids or hyaluronic acid. These products can give immediate relief. In some cases, their benefits can last for months or years. Your vet will sterilize the area to be injected and inject the correct steroid and acid combination. Once you go down the road of injecting a joint, you will likely have to inject the same joint again in the future to keep your horse comfortable.\n3. Ask about joint projectants. Arthritis is caused by a combination of inflammation and degeneration (breaking down) at affected joints. In addition to the products that provide relief from painful inflammation, ones like glucosamine and chondroitin can help protect the joint itself from damage. Your vet can prescribe the right product for your horse.\n4. Supply pain relievers. Some products, including phenylbutazone and firocoxib, won’t treat the joint itself, but will provide your horse with some general pain relief. Your vet will prescribe these for your horse if they believe the medicine will improve the horse’s quality of life. Use painkillers as directed by your veterinarian. Giving pain medication more frequently than recommended or in too large a quantity can damage your horse’s gastrointestinal tract and cause kidney or liver failure.\n5. Expect the issue to progress over time. Medications can definitely help a horse be more comfortable, and caring well for your horse can increase its quality of life. However, it is almost impossible to repair the damage caused by arthritis. Over time, problems caused by arthritis will increase, so it is important to stay in touch with your vet about continued treatment.\n"

        "output": "There are two differences between your buns and a tin can.\nFirst, your buns were heated to a core temperature of under 100°C. Yes, your oven was probably set way higher, but the water content in your filling prevents it from getting hotter than boiling water. Commercial canning is done in the vicinity of 120-130°C, which is possible because the cans are cooked under pressure. So unlike in a can, most pathogens were destroyed, but not necessarily all of them. For human consumption, that’s perfectly fine as long as the remaining ones don’t get the time-temperature combo to regrow.\nSecond, a bread dough may be dense (although the aim is usually something different), but by no means airtight. Interestingly, wrapping meat in dense dough was used as preservation method in medieval times - the “ancestor” of today’s pork pies and pastries. But while the hard flour crust (not intended to be eaten originally) did form a protective layer and usually extended the shelf life more or less, it was by no means food safe judged by modern standards - although some pies were stored for months. But your fluffy buns are truly not a protective layer. Which means you should refrigerate your buns, but also that you get to enjoy the whole dish."

        "output": "Peeled plums are perfect for pies, jam, cakes, and baby food. If you try to peel a plum by simply pulling back the skin, you'll end up with a sticky mess on your hands. Instead, blanch the plums and then place them in an ice bath or trim the skin off with a knife. This simple techniques are quick, easy, and will leave you with delicious plum flesh.\n\n## Blanch plums\n\n1. Boil a pot of water on the stovetop. Choose a pot large enough to hold all your plums and fill half of it with water. It'll probably take about 10 minutes to boil..\n\t* Place a lid on the pot to help the water to boil quicker.\n2. Fill a large bowl with ice and water. Add water and ice to the bowl at a 50:50 ratio. This will act as an ice bath for the plums.\n3. Slice an \"x\" on the bottom of each plum. Use a paring knife to cut a cross hatch at the bottom of the plum (the side opposite the stem). Make each cut to be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. This will make it nice and easy to peel back the skin. Don’t worry about making the cut deep, simply cut through the skin of the plum.\n4. Blanch the plums for 45 seconds in boiling water. Carefully place the plums into the pot of water. It is important not to leave the plums in the water for longer than 45 seconds, as the flesh will go mushy and the plums will start to disintegrate. Always be careful when cooking with hot water to avoid burns.\n5. Submerge the plums in the ice water for 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the plums from the boiling water into the ice bath. The icy water will help to pull the skin away from the flesh of the plums. Make sure that all the plums are fully submerged in the water. If some of the plums aren’t submerged in the ice bath, make another ice bath for them.\n6. Peel the skin off the plums. Place your finger under 1 of the little flaps formed by the \"x\" you sliced, and pull back the flap. The skin should easily come loose in 1 big strip. Keep pulling back the flaps on all four sides until you've completely peeled the plum. If there is still a little skin on the plum, use a paring knife to slice off any remaining skin.\n7. Cut around the circumference of the plum. Press the paring knife firmly into the flesh until it hits the stone. Follow the natural seam in the skin and cut right around the plum. Keeping cutting until you have split the plum in half.If you don’t have a paring knife, use a sharp kitchen knife instead.\n8. Twist each half of the plum in opposite directions to pull it away from the stone. Hold 1 half of the plum in each hand. Firmly grip the halves and slowly turn them away from each other until one half of the plum comes loose from the stone.\n9. Lever the stone out with a spoon. Push a dessert spoon under the stone and then press the handle down to pop the stone out. If the stone won’t coming out, push the spoon under the opposite side of the stone and then lever it out.\n\n\n## Use a knife\n\n1. Cut the plum in half and pop the stone out. Place the plum on a chopping board and cut around the circumference of the plum. Use a teaspoon to pop the stone out of the plum.\n2. Chop both pieces of plum in half. Cut each plum half lengthways to create a wedge. This makes the plum easier to peel.If your plum is particularly large, consider chopping each piece of plum into thirds.\n3. Trim the skin off each plum wedge. Press the skin side of the plum firmly down against the chopping board. Carefully glide the knife as close to the skin as possible to remove the skin from the flesh.Compost the plum skin or use it in smoothies.\n"

        "output": "No. You should always ride with a white light facing forward and a red light facing backwards. If you want additional illumination, you can add multiple white/red lights in the appropriate direction. Amber/yellow lights can be used facing any direction for additional visibility. \nThe first reason is that it's the law:\n\n  (a) Every bicycle when in use during the period from one-half hour after sunset to one-half hour before sunrise shall be equipped with a lamp on the front which shall emit a white light visible during hours of darkness from a distance of at least five hundred feet to the front and with a red or amber light visible to the rear for three hundred feet. Effective July first, nineteen hundred seventy-six, at least one of these lights shall be visible for two hundred feet from each side.\n\nMore importantly for your safety though, the color of a light conveys a certain meaning. Drivers, pedestrians, and other cyclists associate the color red with a taillight and the color white with a headlight. If you put the wrong color facing the wrong direction, people may think you are traveling the opposite direction. Imagine a car is pulling out of a driveway and sees a red bike light flashing to their left. They may assume that means a bike is moving away from them on the left. If they then pull out of the driveway and you're really moving towards them, you could get hit. "

That's a lot of coral. Of course, coral doesn't grow at a depth of a thousand feet, which means that the present shelf collapsed to a lower depth at some point in the past.\"\n\nWhen the character (Barnes, a Navy captain) is talking about precise measurements, he uses metric. When he's being more general, he uses imperial.\nThe main character Norman (a psychologist, not exactly the most mathematically intensive field) uses imperial when thinking to himself.\n\n> He climbed up through the submarine and into a round steel cylinder approximately eight feet in diameter.\n\nBut later, when the astrophysicist Ted is giving officialish measurements the titular sphere, he uses metric:\n\n> \"This object is a burnished sphere approximately ten meters in a diameter, no solid, and composed of a dense metal alloy.\"\n\nSo the short answer is that Crichton is an American writing American characters for a predominantly American audience.

And of course there's the basic how does aperture affect my photographs. And plenty of how do I get super-shallow d.o.f questions. There's related questions like this one. But there's no be-all-end-all question asking:\nWhat exactly determines depth of field in a photograph? \nIs it just a property of the lens? Can lenses be designed to give more depth of field for the same aperture and focal length? Does it change with camera sensor size? Does it change with print size? How do those last two relate?",
        "output": "I'm going to dispense with the formulas, photos of rulers and definitions of \"magnification\" and go with what you actually experience in practice. The major factors that actually matter to shooting are:\n\n* Aperture. Wide aperture lenses give you a shallower depth of field. This is probably the least controversial factor! This is important as some lenses have much larger apertures e.g. 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 vs. 50 f/1.8 \n* Subject distance. This is a really important consideration. Depth of field gets drastically shallower when you start to get really close. This is important as at macro focussing distances DoF is a major problem. It also means you can get shallow DoF regardless of aperture if you get close enough, and that if you want deep DoF in low light compose to focus further away.\n* Focal length. This does affect depth of field, but only in certain ranges, when maintaining subject size. Wide lenses have very deep depth of field at most subject distances. Once you get past a certain point, DoF changes very little with focal length. This is important again because if you want to increase / decrease DoF you can use focal length to do this whilst still filling the frame with your subject.\n* Sensor size. This affects DoF when you maintain the same subject distance and field of view between sensor sizes. The bigger the sensor the shallower the depth of field. DSLRs have much bigger sensors than compacts, and so for the same FoV and f-ratio they have shallower DoF. This is important because by the same token cropping images increases DoF when maintaining the same final output size, as it's akin to using a smaller sensor.\n"

Example: Claymore, Crystal. If no individual author is listed, but the website is produced by a government agency, organization, or business, use that name as the author. For example, if you're using a CDC web page as a source, you would list the author as \"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Tip: For your entire Works Cited entry, if an element doesn't exist or isn't provided, simply skip that part of the citation and move on to the next part.\n2. Provide the title of the page in double quotation marks. If the specific web page has a title, type it after the author's name. Use title case, capitalizing the first word and all nouns, pronouns, adverbs, adjectives, and verbs. Enclose the title in double quotation marks, placing a period at the end of the title, inside the closing quotation marks.

If a publication date is provided next to the content you are citing, include that year in parentheses after the name of the author. Place a period after the closing parentheses. If no date is provided for the specific content you're citing, use the abbreviation \"n.d.\" (for \"no date\") inside the parentheses. Do not use the copyright date for the website itself. Example: Canadian Cancer Society. (2017). If you're citing several pages from the same website that were published in the same year, add a lower-case letter to the end of the year so you can differentiate them in your in-text citations. For example, you might have \"2017a\" and \"2017b.\"\n3. Type the title of the web page in sentence case. Type a space after the period that follows the date, then type the title of the web page, which will usually appear as a header at the top of the page. Use sentence case, capitalizing only the first word and any proper nouns. Place a period at the end of the title. Example: Canadian Cancer Society. (2017). Cancer research. If the content you're citing is a stand-alone document, the title should be italicized. This will usually be the case if you're citing a PDF document that appears on a website.

APA uses author-year parenthetical at the end of any sentence in which you quote or paraphrase information from the website. The parenthetical citation goes inside the closing punctuation for the sentence. For example, you might write: \"Clinical trials are used to test new cancer treatments (Canadian Cancer Society, 2017).\" If you include the author's name in your text, place the year in parentheses immediately after the author's name. For example, you might write: \"The Canadian Cancer Society (2017) noted that Canada is a global leader in clinical trials of cancer treatments.\"\n\n\n## Chicago\n\n1.

Example: UN Women. \"Commission on the Status of Women.\"\n3. Add the name of the website or publishing organization in italics. If the website has a distinct name, include this after the title of the webpage. If it doesn't, use the name of the business, organization, or government agency that produces the website. Place a period at the end of the name. Example: UN Women. \"Commission on the Status of Women.\" UN Women.\n4. Provide the publication date or access date. If the content you're citing has a specific publication date associated with it, provide that date in month-day-year format. If no publication date is listed, type the word \"Accessed\" followed by the date you accessed the content in month-day-year format. Spell out the names of all months. Example: UN Women. \"Commission on the Status of Women.\" UN Women. Accessed February 14, 2019.\n5. Close your entry with a direct URL to the web page. Copy the full URL for the permalink of the web page and paste it into your bibliographic entry. Place a period at the end of the URL. If the URL is overly lengthy, talk to your instructor, editor, or supervisor about using a shortened link. Example: UN Women. \"Commission on the Status of Women.\" UN Women. Accessed February 14, 2019. http://www.unwomen.org/en/csw. Chicago Bibliography Format:\n\t* Author Last Name, First Name. \"Title of Web Page in Title Case.\" Name of Website or Publishing Organization. Accessed Month Day, Year. URL.\n6. Use commas instead of periods between elements in footnotes. A Chicago-style footnote generally includes all of the same information as the bibliographic entry. However, the footnote is treated as a sentence, with elements separated by commas. If there was an individual author listed, their name should be listed with their first name first, followed by their last name, just as you would do it if you wrote it in text. Example: UN Women, \"Commission on the Status of Women,\" UN Women, accessed February 14, 2019, http://www.unwomen.org/en/csw.\n"

        "output": "Democracies come in various shapes and sizes. One way of classifying democracies is into presidential, semi-presidential, and parliamentary democracies. The key differences lie in the checks and balances between the executive branch (the government) and the legislative branch (the legislature):\n\n*  In a presidential democracy, the government is not responsible to the legislature, i.e. it cannot be removed by a vote of no-confidence. For example, in the United States, the president is elected separately from Congress, and cannot be removed by congress during their term, apart from extreme circumstances (impeachment and conviction).\n\n*  In a semi-presidential democracy, the head of state is elected independently of the legislature, and is not responsible to the legislature, but the government is. For example, France is a semi-presidential democracy, where the president is elected directly by the citizens, but the government and prime minister are voted in by the parliament.\n\n*  In a parliamentary democracy, the government is responsible to the legislature, aligning the executive and legislative branches. Many parliamentary democracies elect their head of state via the legislature, while others, such as the United Kingdom, have a hereditary head of state."

How aggressive (proactive) must one be? This question is important since a postdoc cannot just wait for the adviser to give him/her inputs. Rather the postdoc must take the project(s) as another PhD research of his own but be completely accountable to the adviser in terms of what he/she is doing and how is he/she doing that.\nThe above are my thoughts.

        "output": "You'll very quickly learn that being an academic involves more than just writing research papers. Your time as a postdoc is when you can start learning about these other aspects, while building your own profile.\nA postdoc needs to do the following:\n\n* Build a publication record. This will involve both what you are paid to do and your own line of research.\n* Get involved with supervising students. Help with the PhDs in the lab, and get involved in supervising masters students.\n* Get involved with obtaining funding. This can either be by helping your employer or (ideally) obtaining your own funding. \n* Build an international reputation.\n* Start collaborating with external parties.\n* Gain some teaching experience. This is absolutely crucial if you want a faculty position.\n* Learn how to manage projects and a lab. This includes overseeing the progress of projects, allocating your time (and others), presenting results at meetings and  writing deliverables. If you are in a lab setting, you will need to learn how  to fix/calibrate/maintain critical equipment and software so that you can start your own lab some day, and you will need to become proficient in teaching more junior members on how to use that equipment.\n* Start to devise a strategic research plan. While it is fun to do opportunistic research, solving a problem that comes along or investigating any idea that pops into your head, a better long term strategy is to formulate an interesting long term research plan and follow it, building result upon result.\n\nBe as proactive as humanly possible, without being annoying.

        "instruction": "How to be creative when playing with your barbies?",
        "output": "There are endless fun possibilities when it comes to playing with Barbies. If you need ideas for activities, consider doing things like creating a beach for Barbie, pretending she's a doctor to help sick patients, or hosting a fashion show to show off all of her clothing. You can also create things for Barbie, such as furniture to go in her house or new clothing for her to wear.\n\n## Do activities with barbie\n\n1. Create your own Barbie mansion to play house with Barbie. If you bought a playhouse just for Barbie, great! If not, empty a bookshelf or stack empty boxes on top of one another on their sides to create your own. You can fill it with furniture and have Barbie decorate her home, use her kitchen, lounge in her bedroom, or chat with friends in her living room. Have Barbie throw a dinner party in her home, inviting other dolls and eating great food. Barbie could host a sleepover at her house and watch a funny movie.\n2. Turn Barbie into a doctor to have her help patients. Pretend that Barbie is a doctor or nurse and create an office for her to see sick patients. Use other dolls or toys to be the sick patients, and have Barbie check their throat, ears, nose, temperature, and breathing to see if she can help them get better. Pretend Barbie is a surgeon and is operating on another doll to save its life, or have Barbie fix up another doll’s broken arm or ankle.\n3. Take Barbie to the beach by playing in a sandy spot. Use an outdoor sandbox, sandy section of your yard, or build your own beach by pouring sand into a plastic tub indoors. Let Barbie relax on a towel under a beach umbrella in the sand while she reads a book or talks to a friend. Use a piece of fabric or a washcloth as Barbie’s beach towel. Put Barbie in her bathing suit so she can soak up some sun. Create a beach umbrella using a decorative drink umbrella, or by cutting an umbrella shape out of paper and sticking a toothpick or pencil through the middle. Add a small tub of water next to the sand to create an “ocean.”\n4. Send Barbie to the hair salon to fix up her hair. To smooth out any tangles in Barbie’s hair, dip her hair in a mixture of fabric softener and water and then use a brush to brush out the tangles. Curl Barbie’s hair using pipe cleaners and hot water, or dye her hair with food coloring mixed with water. To curl Barbie’s hair, take small sections of her hair and roll each section up on a small piece of pipe cleaner, just as you would real hair curlers. Dip her hair in hot water and let it dry. Mix a drop or 2 of food coloring in a bowl of water before dipping Barbie’s hair into the colored water. This works best if Barbie has blonde hair.\n5. Let Barbie be a teacher to teach other dolls new things. Set up a school room with rows of chairs and desks for the doll students to sit and learn, and have Barbie write lessons on a chalkboard to teach everyone things like math, science, or foreign languages. You can even create small books for everyone to read and learn from! Barbie doesn’t just have to be a school teacher - have her teach other dolls how to ride a horse, how to make a cake, or how to swim. Tape a piece of paper up on the wall to use as the chalkboard. Make books by cutting paper into sections that are roughly 1 in (2.5 cm) wide and 2 in (5.1 cm) long. Fold these sections in half and add a staple right on the folded line.\n6. Have Barbie star in her own movie using a video camera or phone. This could be an action movie where Barbie is involved in a high-speed car chase, a romantic movie where Barbie falls in love with someone, or any other genre that you like. Use a phone or video camera to film each scene so you can watch it later on. Plan out each scene before filming, such as which props you’ll need and what Barbie will say. Ask friends or family members to help you shoot the movie so that you can have more characters in it. For example, you could film the movie outside and pretend that Barbie is stuck on an island and needs to be rescued.\n7. Take Barbie on a road trip if she has her own car. Pack up Barbie’s car with snacks, clothing, and any other gear she’ll need for a road trip, or use your imagination and use a cardboard box as her car. Have Barbie travel from room to room, meeting new people and trying new things. Barbie could also travel by plane, bus, boat, bicycle, or train. For example, you could pretend that each room in your house is a different country, and Barbie takes a plane to France, Greece, and Japan to try out their food. Take Barbie on a road trip to go shopping, hear music, or experience a festival.\n8. Create a pool for Barbie using a sink or plastic container. Fill a bowl or plastic container with water and dress Barbie up in her swimsuit so that she can go swimming. Make sure Barbie is able to get wet before dipping her in the water, especially if she has a special hairdo. Have Barbie throw a pool party and invite her friends. Play music, have Barbie sit on a pool towel next to the pool, or let her practice doing fun dives into the water.\n9. Put on a fashion show using Barbie’s clothing. Dress Barbie in fancy dresses, businesswoman attire, lounge wear, or in crazy costumes. Use the clothing you already have for Barbie, or create new clothing using materials around your house such as balloons, pieces of fabric, or old socks. Play music while putting on the fashion show so that Barbie can strut down the runway. For example, dress Barbie up like a princess, astronaut, ballerina, basketball player, or celebrity.\n\n\n## Make clothe and furniture for barbie\n\n1. Cut up balloons to make clothing for Barbie. Cut both ends of the balloon off using scissors to create a skirt or strapless dress, or design more detailed shirts and dresses by cutting arm holes into the balloon. Slide the balloon up over Barbie’s body starting at her feet once you’re done. The balloon should be deflated to use it as clothing.\n2. Create a dress out of a piece of fabric. Look around the house to find spare pieces of fabric used for sewing or projects. To make a super simple dress, cut a circle out of the fabric with a diameter of about 1 foot (30 cm). Cut a small hole for Barbie’s head right in the middle, and then 2 arm holes on either side. Slide the dress over Barbie’s head and use a ribbon or piece of string to tie it at the waist. Make sure the main hole in Barbie’s dress is big enough for her head to fit through. Design more complicated pieces of clothing, such as pants or long-sleeve shirts, if desired.\n3. Cover sponges in fabric to create a comfy couch. Find pieces of fabric for sewing or crafts around the house and cut them into squares large enough to fit over the sponge, leaving 1 in (2.5 cm) of extra fabric on each side. You can either sew the fabric to create a cover for the sponge, or you can glue the fabric onto the sponge. Do this with at least 2 sponges and then place one flat on the ground with the other up against a wall as a backrest. For a super comfy couch, make the seat of the couch out of 2 sponges stacked on top of one another. To create a long sectional, use 4-6 sponges to form the couch.\n4. Stack empty matchboxes on top of one another to form drawers. You can color, paint, or cover the outside of the matchboxes with paper beforehand, if desired. Place the matchboxes on top of one another, adding drops of glue in between each layer to keep them all in place. Place Barbie’s things, such as her hairbrush, phone, mirror, or books, in the drawers. If you only have one matchbox, prop the matchbox up on something like a piece of cardboard or paper clips and turn it into a one-drawer nightstand. Cover the new drawers with stickers, glitter, or pictures.\n5. Turn a shoebox into a bed for Barbie. Find an old shoebox from your closet, garage, or other storage spot and empty it out. Place a washcloth or small blanket inside, as well as something that will be used as a pillow. Now Barbie has a bed ready for sleeping! Create a pillow by stuffing a piece of fabric or a cloth bag with tissues or stuffing. Decorate the sides of the bed using markers, pencils, or paint.\n6. Tie ribbon onto a small hair band to make a tutu for Barbie. Find an extra hair tie and ribbon that you like. Cut the ribbon into 6 in (15 cm) sections, and then tie the ribbon onto the hair tie so that the middle of the ribbon is where the knot is. Do this all the way around the hair tie to create a fun tutu. Use different colored or patterned ribbon to make the tutu super colorful. If your hair tie is too big and won’t fit Barbie, find a rubber band and cut it before tying a new knot to make it the perfect size.\n7. Design chairs using cardboard and paper clips. Use scissors to cut cardboard into strips that are at least 3 in (7.6 cm) wide. By bending these strips of cardboard, you can create simple chairs or chaise lounges. If you want the chair to stand up off the ground, bend paper clips to form chair ends and use glue or tape to attach them to the bottom of the chairs. Fold a 6 in (15 cm) long piece of cardboard in half to create a simple chair. Fold a 9 in (23 cm) long piece of cardboard into thirds to form a chaise lounge.\n"

        "instruction": "How to walk with a sprained ankle?",
        "output": "Before you start walking with a sprained ankle, make sure you get your doctor’s permission so you don’t cause any more damage. Ideally, you should only walk on a sprain that’s mild, and you should periodically strengthen your ankle through exercise so it gets stronger as you go. If you ever feel any pain, stop immediately and see your doctor for medical help.\n\n## Walk on a sprain ankle\n\n1. Apply ice to your ankle as soon as you can after you sprain it. As soon as you can, rest your ankle and put an ice pack on it to decrease the swelling. Keep the ice on your ankle for 10-15 minutes at a time 2-3 times per day to help alleviate some of the pain. As you start to feel more comfortable, ice your ankle only once or twice a day, or whenever it feels swollen.\n2. Take an anti-inflammatory medication to relieve pain and swelling. Opt for ibuprofen or naproxen, and take the recommended dose for your age as it is written on the packaging. However, if you haven’t seen a doctor yet, do that as soon as possible, since your doctor may prescribe a higher dose or more specific medication. A typical over-the-counter dose of ibuprofen for an adult is 400 mg, three times per day. A doctor may prescribe a much higher dose depending on the severity of your injury and your size. The doctor may also prescribe narcotic pain relievers for you if the pain is severe. Always check with your pharmacist or doctor before taking any medication in addition to a prescription. Side effects may include constipation, drowsiness, and addiction if taken for too long a period. Acetaminophen can reduce pain, but does not reduce swelling.\n3. Protect your ankle with a compression bandage, brace, splint, or high-top shoes. If the sprain is severe, the doctor will prescribe a walking boot or a splint for you. If not, try to wrap a compression bandage or brace around your ankle for 1-3 weeks. Wear boots or high-top shoes that can be laced up tight around your ankles for added support. Wearing high heels with a sprained ankle could lead to further injury. If you have to wear dress shoes, choose flats over heels. In addition to using compression bandages, be sure to rest, ice, and elevate your ankle to help alleviate the pain.\n4. Check your surroundings for uneven ground or stairs before walking around. Be aware of where you are going to be walking so that you are not caught off-guard by loose rocks or potholes in a path or sidewalk. If your path looks rough or rocky, try to find a smoother alternative route, or ask a friend for help.\n5. Walk slowly and take small steps. Look out for spills, things on your path that you can trip over, or anything else in your way that might cause further injury. If you try to walk too quickly, you might miss potential hazards in your way. Concentrating on your walking will help you to not only stay safe and prevent injury but will also make you very aware of your pain level and your healing progress. Whenever possible, hold on to railings or ask a friend if you can lean on them for added support.\n6. Pause when needed and shift your weight to your uninjured foot. Listen to your body. If the pain is too intense to keep going, take a break and relieve your injured ankle of pressure by shifting your body’s weight to the other foot. Some pain is unavoidable, but if you cannot maintain a conversation or lose breath as you walk because of the pain, then you should pause and rest.\n\n\n## Strengthen your ankle after a sprain\n\n1. Stretch the ligaments in your ankle with an exercise band or rolled towel. To do this exercise, wrap a resistance band or a large rolled-up towel around the ball of your injured foot and straighten your leg. Then, point your toes up, down, left, and right. For best results, repeat the cycle of motions 10 times and do the exercise 3 times per day. You do not need to wear shoes or supportive braces for this exercise.\n2. Balance yourself on your injured ankle to increase your stability. Make sure you’re standing on a hard, flat surface before you stand on your injured foot. Try not to hold on to anything as you balance, but make sure there’s a railing or wall nearby so you can catch yourself if you need to. As you work to maintain your balance, your ankle will shift back and forth, stretching out and strengthening the ligaments and muscles. You should wear shoes for this exercise to give your foot some traction and prevent a fall. Make this exercise more challenging by using a balance board instead of a flat surface. The tipping motion of the board will force your ankle to act against the movements, increasing its strength and stability.\n3. Draw the alphabet on the floor using your injured foot. Sit in a comfortable chair with both feet resting flat on the floor. Then, with your injured foot, use your big toe to slowly trace the entire alphabet on the floor, one letter at a time. Drawing letters encourages ankle movement in every direction. Repeat up to three times for maximum stretching and strengthening. You do not need to wear shoes for this exercise since you are sitting and do not need the extra support or traction. If you cannot reach the floor, you can draw the letters in the air for a similar result.\n4. Swing your knees from side to side to stretch and strengthen your ankle. As you sit in a comfortable chair with your feet flat on the floor, slowly swing your knees as far as you can from side to side. Keep your foot pressed flat to the floor and continue for 3 minutes. If you want to wear shoes while doing this exercise, opt for low-profile shoes that will not limit your ankle’s range of motion.\n\n\n## Prevent further injury\n\n1. Rest your sprained ankle after walking to give it some time to heal. By exercising and walking on your sprained ankle, you will be putting a lot of strain on the ligaments. Give them a break by taking the pressure off of them for at least an hour after walking, giving them time to rest and heal.\n2. Ice your ankle to relieve pain and swelling. After walking on your injured ankle, it will probably be swollen and painful because of the stress it was under. Elevate your foot and hold a cold ice pack wrapped in a towel on your ankle for 10-20 minutes. If your ankle is really swollen, you can reapply the ice again after 10 minutes and continue the cycle of 10-20 minutes on, 10 minutes off, until the swelling goes down. A great substitute for an ice pack is a frozen bag of peas because it is cold and easily molds to the body part that you are icing. Wrapping the ice pack in a towel is important because you can damage your skin by applying ice directly to it.\n3. Compress your ankle using an elastic sports bandage. Wrap your foot from the base of your toes to about 3 inches (7.6 cm) above your ankle. Provide extra support by crisscrossing the bandage from left to right in a figure-eight motion around your ankle and heel. Secure it into place with metal fasteners or tape. You want the compression bandage tight enough to give gentle pressure, but not so tight that restricts blood flow. If you have any tingling or discoloration in your toes, remove the bandage and rewrap it looser. It’s not a good idea to sleep with a compression bandage on because it may reduce blood flow.\n4. Elevate your ankle to speed up healing by reducing swelling. When you are sitting or laying down, keep your ankle elevated to reduce swelling by allowing fluid to drain from the injured area. If possible, lay down and keep your ankle elevated above your heart.\n"

Jason couldn't help but feel a bit of complacency as he hoisted himself out of the bunker. His peers did nothing but jeer and ridicule him for his efforts to survive the apocalypse.\n\"Look whose laughing now,\" he mused.\nBased on his watch it was 4 in the afternoon. The campus was desolate. Not a single person in sight. All of a sudden he heard the ruffle of leaves.\nJason snapped his head around and screwed up his eyes over the horizon. It was a throng of people coming closer to him by the minute. He couldn't make out their faces. They were moving in a weird way too, sluggish and dragging their feet.\nThats when he started to hear them moan. Jason's heart skipped a beat. He threw open lid of his bunker and dived inside.\nThe moans grew louder. He peaked over his bunker as the crowd made its way toward him. Thats when he realized they weren't people at all. They had eyes that were sunken in and faces with skin that hung loose. Some of them had missing skin and tufts of missing hair.\nThe moaning was almost deafening now. The crowd looked-\n\"Dead.\" Jason thought. \"They are walking dead people! I'm the only living person left!\"\nHe closed the lid of his bunker. It looked like he was going to be inside longer than he thought.\n\n\"Amazing job today guys!\"\nEdward, the president of the Zombie Club, wiped the makeup off his brow and turned to address his members.\n\"I loved the moans and groans, and your costumes look fantastic!\" he exclaimed."

I've obviously used regular casts i.e.\n```MyClass *m = (MyClass *)ptr;\n```\nall over the place, but there seem to be two other types of casts, and I don't know the difference. What's the difference between the following lines of code?\n```MyClass *m = (MyClass *)ptr;\nMyClass *m = static_cast(ptr);\nMyClass *m = dynamic_cast(ptr);\n```",
        "output": "## static_cast\n\n`static_cast` is used for cases where you basically want to reverse an implicit conversion, with a few restrictions and additions. `static_cast` performs no runtime checks. This should be used if you know that you refer to an object of a specific type, and thus a check would be unnecessary. Here is an example:\n\n```\nvoid func(void *data) {\n  // Conversion from MyClass* -> void* is implicit\n  MyClass *c = static_cast<MyClass*>(data);\n  ...\n}\n\nint main() {\n  MyClass c;\n  start_thread(&func, &c)  // func(&c) will be called\n      .join();\n}\n```\nIn this example, you know that you passed a `MyClass` object, and thus there isn't any need for a runtime check to ensure this.\n\n## dynamic_cast\n\n`dynamic_cast` is useful when you don't know what the dynamic type of the object is. It returns a null pointer if the object referred to doesn't contain the type casted to as a base class (when you cast to a reference, a `bad_cast` exception is thrown in that case).\n\n```\nif (JumpStm *j = dynamic_cast<JumpStm*>(&stm)) {\n  ...\n} else if (ExprStm *e = dynamic_cast<ExprStm*>(&stm)) {\n  ...\n}\n```\nAn \"up-cast\" (cast to the base class) is always valid with both `static_cast` and `dynamic_cast`, and also without any cast, as an \"up-cast\" is an implicit conversion (assuming the base class is accessible, i.e. it's a `public` inheritance).\n\n## Regular Cast\n\nThese casts are also called C-style cast. A C-style cast is basically identical to trying out a range of sequences of C++ casts, and taking the first C++ cast that works, without ever considering `dynamic_cast`. Needless to say, this is much more powerful as it combines all of `const_cast`, `static_cast` and `reinterpret_cast`, but it's also unsafe, because it does not use `dynamic_cast`.\n\nIn addition, C-style casts not only allow you to do this, but they also allow you to safely cast to a private base-class, while the \"equivalent\" `static_cast` sequence would give you a compile-time error for that.\n\nSome people prefer C-style casts because of their brevity. I use them for numeric casts only, and use the appropriate C++ casts when user defined types are involved, as they provide stricter checking."

        "output": "Some people may find Sonic Unleashed on the Xbox 360 hard. But it's pretty easy with practice. Some may find it hard to press several buttons quickly.\n\n## Controller basics\n\n1. When you're holding the controller, put your index & middle finger on the trigger and bumper buttons (so you'll be ready to drift when needed) and put your left thumb on the right analog stick and left thumb on the A,X,Y and B buttons.\n2. The left control stick is used to move Sonic; the A button is used for jumping ; the B button is used to boost; the X button is used to stomp or crouch; the Y button is used for the light speed dash; the trigger buttons are used for drifting; and the bumper buttons are used for side stepping left and right.\n3. Many new skills and upgrades can be obtained through certain conditions, progressing through the game, or by buying them with yellow diamonds you get from enemies.\n\n\n## Boost guidelines\n\n1. To reach the highest speeds, drift in a straight line (this is not something you need to do, but it does speed you along and again it's more of an expert technique).\n2. When you're on a slope going upwards, when near you're near top of it, jump and it will give you maximum height and to boost over some areas.\n3. Try boosting then jumping right after then boosting again in the air to boost over a whole area.\n\n\n## Attack techniques\n\n1. The main method of defeating enemies is the homing attack. Try to use this also for combo attacks for bonus points and getting to places beyond Sonic's reach or to correct any missed/wrongly timed jumps.\n2. Stomping is another way of attacking enemies and is used best when attacking from above or when a homing attack doesn't work or isn't as effective.\n3. Ironically enough, you can actually use the speed boost and drift to take down groups of enemies at high speeds that you normally can't take down or would take longer with conventional attack moves.\n\n\n## 2d platforming\n\n1. 2D sections are more platform based and as a result are much harder and take longer to do. Remember to not be as reckless when going through these sections; do not use the speed boost unless Sonic is running in a harmless path.\n2. Properly time your homing attacks, crouches, light speed dashes, and wall jumps by being as fast as possible, pressing the button combos well, and by following the on-screen button prompt as it's needed in order to succeed through 2D platforming.\n3. Take alternate routes with cannons, grind rails, zip-lines, and other mechanisms to skip large portions of the 2D sections with little to no risk.\n\n\n## Trick\n\n1. There are many tricks and techniques that aren't mentioned in the game or is difficult to pull off. One should master them to beat the levels more easily and have a better time, which includes the aerial boost, parkour, sky diving, and drifting.\n2. Aerial boosting is simply pressing a set of buttons that appear on-screen when Sonic files into the air and everything becomes slow; successfully pressing these buttons within a short time allows Sonic to go over gaps and reach out of reach places.\n3. Parkour tricks such as running on walls and wall-jumping (in 3D areas) can be utilized by speed boosting on walls and pressing the button that appears on-screen when Sonic attempts to wall-jump on certain walls.\n4. Sky diving is simply diving really fast while in the air after Sonic is free falling to an area below; pressing the X button will increase your speed while titling the control stick controls your position which can help avoid obstacles and reach the ground faster.\n5. Drifting is turning around sharp corners without losing speed; this is difficult to maneuver as Sonic's natural speed interferes with his handling - simply tilt the control stick left and right (slightly) to make drifting easier to do.\n"

        "output": "There are thousands of Halloween decorations you could go out to the store and buy, but often they look generic and plastic-y, don't they? Why not make your own? Using household items, you can make your own ghosts, bats, spiders, and pumpkins! Here's how.\n\n## Ghostly spirit jugs\n\n1. Clean several plastic milk jugs. You don't need to cut them out or in any way modify them -- they just need to be clean. Each one will be one ghost -- how many milk jugs do you need?\n2. Draw a face on the jugs. You can either use a black permanent marker, felt, or any material you have lying around the house. The permanent marker will be the easiest to make a detailed face with. While you do this, only work on the side without the handles and leave the caps on the jugs. The air forced to stay inside by the caps will make it easier to work with, keeping it sturdy. You don't have to go Martha Stewart on this project. Just a circle for a mouth and circles for eyes (leave a little white for the pupils) can be cute, too.\n3. Cut a small hole in the back of the jug. Use a craft knife to cut a hole the size of a half dollar or a bit bigger than a pound coin. Place the hole about 2/3 of the way up the jug. This won't be seen. If it's not perfect, don't worry about it. Just don't leave any sharp edges!\n4. Stuff the jug with Christmas or fairy lights. You can either use a whole string for one jug, or thread several jugs with a single string. Arrange the jugs together, plug in the cord, and voila! These little buggers work great lining a walk or a patio or table edge. They dim the lighting just enough to glow in a very Halloween-y feel!\n\n\n## Flapping bats\n\n1. Cut a body, two wings, and the head of a bat (with ears!) out of a piece of paper. You can find a template online or you can freehand it. Make the body a little on the chubby side so you have room to attach the wings without drawing away from its size.\n2. Trace your template onto black craft foam. Cut out the foam to match the template. This project looks best if you have about 6 or so bats. They need friends!\n3. Punch several holes into the bat to join the pieces together. Punch two holes on each wing, close to where the wings would attach to the body. Leave a little space around all sides so the holes don't turn into rips. Also punch a hole at the bottom of the body, to attach a string later (around where a tail would be). The holes just have to be big enough to put a metal brad through. This is how the wings will flap.\n4. Align the holes on the body and the wings together and fasten with a brad. Since there are two holes on each side, use the one that's closest to the wing tip. Place a paper fastener or a brad through the hole and secure loosely (it's best to use a black fastener or color your gold brad).\n5. Thread a string through the empty holes and tie in a loop. That's why you pierced two holes in each bat initially! You'll probably want at least 10 inches (25 cm) of string (or dental floss), so the string is easy to grab. This is how you'll manipulate the wings. When you hang your bat up, you can just give the string a tug and away he'll go!\n6. Attach a ribbon and red sequin eyes. Thread the ribbon through the bottom hole to hang the bat upside down from your wall or ledge. Tie it in a loop and knot. Then, make red eyes with sequins. Googly eyes work, too!\n\n\n## Flowerpot pumpkins\n\n1. Purchase a few terra cotta pots. Having a variety of sizes will give you a pumpkin family! Make sure they're clean if you had them laying around the house. You want them very orange to simulate pumpkins.\n2. Cut the parts of a face out of yellow craft paper. If you don't have craft paper, use scrapbook paper, card, or wrapping paper. Anything that's bendy and colorful will work. Make arched evil eyebrows, a handlebar mustache, surprised eyes, or any detail that you'd like your pumpkin pots to have. The simpler your face, the more it will look like a jack-o-lantern. Give it a toothy grin, a triangular nose, and triangular eyes to make it look more pumpkin-esque.\n3. Brush the surface of the pot with outdoor modge-podge. You only need a layer on the side you'll place the face for right now. Use a sponge brush or paint brush for best results. A thin, but even layer is ideal.\n4. Apply the pieces of the face to the upside down pot. Press them firmly into place. Then, apply a thin layer of the sticky stuff all over the pot, effectively weather-proofing it.\n5. Insert a stick into the end for a stem. When we say stick, we mean stick. Go outside under a tree and find a stick to fit through the bottom of your terra cotta pot. And there it is -- a pumpkin that won't rot in a week's time!\n\n\n## Giant spooky spiders\n\n1. Cut off the spout of an empty, clean milk jug. Just below the lid is what you don't want. Use a craft knife to make this easy -- scissors will be difficult to work with. Make sure your milk jug is clean! If there's still a milky residue it may end up smelling.\n2. Cover the jug with black tape. This will form the body of your spider. Go as tightly around the handle as you can; but don't worry -- if it's still discernible, that's fine.\n3. Get 4 6-foot (2 m) black foam pipe insulation tubes that are 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) in diameter. These will be the legs. Tape each one in the center along the handle of the jug. Then, tape the tubes along the sides of the jug too, to make it look as if the legs are going along the body. The tubes will bend into place.\n4. Cut a slit at a joint in the legs. If you cut a slit in the tube, it will bend at your cut. If you hold it in the bend, you can tape it to stay permanently bent. This will form the joints in your spiders legs. A 1\" (2.5 cm) triangle cut is good -- the tube won't unexpectedly break off. Just hold it at its bending point and wrap tape around the newly-formed joint.\n5. Use two halves of a plastic Easter egg for eyes. They'll bulge out and be adequately creepy -- especially if you cut a slit of black tape for pupils. If you don't have an egg lying around, puff balls (or anything circular, really) work as well. Just attach them to the jug with more tape or glue.\n\n\n## Adorable hanging ghosts\n\n1. Create your ghost form with two small paper cups. Turn the first one upside down, then place the second one on top of that. To make it stable, tape or glue the bottoms together. You won't actually be using the cups as part of the ghost -- it's just used for sizing in the initial stages. So if you don't want to fuss with tape, don't worry about it!\n2. Inflate a small balloon and put it in the top cup. But not too much! If it's too big it won't fit in the cup. Make it so it fills out the cup, like a round poof of whipped cream tops a mug of hot chocolate.\n3. Soak pieces of cheesecloth in fabric stiffener. You'll want to work with pieces that are about 8 inches (20 cm) square. Grab a bowl and fill it with fabric stiffener, soaking each piece thoroughly. About 10 seconds per piece will do the job nicely.\n4. Immediately drape over the balloon. After you've soaked a piece, drape it over the balloon and move onto the next piece. Center the pieces, evenly draped over the balloon, but not perfectly uniform. Once you've finished with all your pieces, let it dry for about ten minutes. It will then harden and take shape.\n5. Pop the balloon! This will require a needle or other pointy object since you can't go smashing your creation on the floor (well, you could, if you get really frustrated -- but that'd defeat the purpose). After you do so, you should be left with a free-floating white ghost-like creation. Isn't Halloween the best?\n6. Remove from the cup and rough up the edges. The ends should look tattered, as if they're wafting in some sort of unregisterable-to-humans breeze. Just bending them with your fingers should do the trick.\n7. Attach felt eyes and fishing line to hang. Little tiny black dots for eyes are all these little guys need to be cute and not at all ominous. Black sequins or beads can work, too. As for the fishing line, just thread it through the cheesecloth, loop, and tie in a knot! Hang your new buddies from lights, shelves, windows, or the ceiling.\n\n\n## Eyes in a bush\n\n1. Get an empty toilet paper roll, and a glowstick. You can easily find both at a dollar store.\n2. Cut out two football shaped eye holes. Place them about two to three inches (5 to 7.5cm) apart.\n3. Put the glowsticks in the center of the toilet paper roll. Do not cause them to glow until they need to be used as a decoration on the night of Halloween.\n4. Put the roll(s) in your bushes/trees. When you cause the glowsticks tot work, you will have scary eyes in a bush!\n\n\n## Paper bag ghosts\n\n1. Obtain rubber bands and a white paper bag.\n2. Draw a ghost face on the paper bag.\n3. Put the rubber band around the middle of the bag.\n4. Decorate. Add the face of a ghost and any other designs.\n5. Hang up from the ceiling, on branches, etc.\n\n\n## Scary halloween candy bowl\n\n1. Get a fake hand, a bowl, glue, and candy. The glue must be non-toxic as food is going to come into contact with it.\n2. Glue the fake hand onto the bottom of the bowl.\n3. Let the glue dry for about two to three hours.\n4. Fill the bowl with candy.\n5. Set the bowl out for the trick or treaters.\n"

        "output": "Birds are both flying dinosaurs and flying reptiles. Yes, that's potentially confusing.\n\nTo understand the apparent contradiction, you have to understand how modern classification of organisms works (phylogenetic systematics). Under the old (Linnean) classification system, Reptilia (reptiles) was an order and Aves (birds) was a separate order. Phylogenetic systematics, which has completely replaced the Linnean system, views all organisms as interrelated in a nested set of monophyletic groups (clades). It's like a set of venn diagrams, where all organisms fall into a giant circle and then successively smaller circles classify more and more specific groups.\n\nThe clade Reptilia includes snakes, lizards, crocodiles, and lots of extinct groups, including dinosaurs. So all dinosaurs are reptiles. The clade Dinosauria includes all the extinct dinosaurs (Stegosaurus, Triceratops, sauropods, etc.), including theropod dinosaurs, which include well known dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus and Allosaurus. Based on a mountain on anatomical evidence, including lots of transitional fossils, living birds are a sub-group of theropod dinosaurs.\n\nSo all birds (Aves) are theropod dinosaurs (Dinosauria: Theropoda). All dinosaurs are reptiles. Therefore, birds are dinosaurs and reptiles. They are just more closely related to dinosaurs than to other reptiles.\nThe tricky part is that most people have an intuitive idea of what \"reptiles\" and \"dinosaurs\" are. To a systematist, whose job it is to classify organisms, these terms don't mean the same thing as they do to most people. Systematists think about groups like Reptilia and Dinosauria and how those groups are related to one another. So they have no problem saying that birds are dinosaurs and reptiles, because birds are nested within both of those groups.\n\nA few words about pterosaurs\nAlong with birds and bats, pterosaurs are the other clade of vertebrates capable of powered, flapping flight. Pterosaurs fall within Reptilia (and Diapsida and Archosauria) along with Dinosauria, which includes birds. There are a lot of other extinct lineages in the tree that are not shown, e.g., ornithodirans that are not dinosaurs and not pterosaurs. Pterosaurs and birds share anatomical features that all reptiles, diapsids, archosaurs, and ornithodirans have, which is how we know that they are more closely related to each other than to other groups, like crocodiles. But their flight structures evolved independently and are anatomically distinct fro one another. So pterosaurs are flying reptiles but not flying dinosaurs.\nThese images might help you understand the above explanation."

        "instruction": "How do weather models work?",
        "output": "All numerical atmospheric models are built around calculations derived from primitive equations that describe atmospheric flow. Vilhelm Bjerknes discovered the relationships and thereby became the father of numerical weather prediction. Conceptually, the equations can be thought of as describing how a parcel of air would move in relationship to its surroundings. For instance, we learn at a young age that hot air rises. The hydrostatic vertical momentum equation explains why and quantifies under what condictions hot air would stop rising. (As the air rises it expands and cools until it reaches hydrostatic equilibrium.) The other equations consider other types of motion and heat transfer.\n\nUnfortunately, the equations are nonlinear, which means that you can't simply plug in a few numbers and get useful results. Instead, weather models are simulations which divide the atmosphere into three-dimensional grids and calculate how matter and energy will flow from one cube of space into another during discrete time increments. Actual atmospheric flow is continuous, not discrete, so by necessity the models are approximations. Different models make different approximations appropriate to their specific purpose.\n\nNumerical models have been improving over time for several reasons:\n\n* More and better input data,\n* Tighter grids, and\n* Better approximations.\n\nIncreasing computational power has allowed models to use smaller grid boxes. However, the number of computations increases exponentially with the number of boxes and the process suffers diminishing returns. On the input end of things, more and better sensors improve the accuracy of the initial conditions of the model. Synoptic scale and mesoscale models take input from General Circulation Models, which helps set reasonable intial conditions. On the output end, Model Output Statistics do a remarkable job of estimating local weather by comparing the current model state with historical data of times when the model showed similar results. Finally, ensemble models take the output of several models as input and produce a range of possibly outcomes."

        "instruction": "When an expendable booster rocket stage nears the end of its burn, does the guidance computer shut the engine(s) off at a certain velocity/altitude for the mission, or does the stage completely exhaust its propellants?",
        "output": "First stages are generally run to depletion (though not complete depletion). First stage ascents often use a preprogrammed, open loop guidance system to get out of the atmosphere with a good chunk of downrange velocity. Because winds aloft and other factors may vary, first stage performance also varies somewhat.\nUpper stage guidance is almost always closed loop, targeting a specific position and velocity combination. As a result, upper stages of boosters are shut down when that target is reached, with some amount of reserve propellants left to cover dispersions during ascent and a disposal burn.\nLiquid fueled first stages are not run dry. Cutoff is triggered with some amount left in the tank. This is because the turbopumps operate at ridiculous velocities and need something to pump, at a specific inlet pressure. The heat source (gas generator, expander, or preburner) that drives the pump is downstream of the inlet in the flow path, so cutoff has to happen by cutting off the drive force to the pump before the inlet loses pressure or runs dry. \nIf that pressure drops below minimum specifications or if the inlet goes dry, you will get cavitation and/or overspeed conditions, both of which would result in a violent reconfiguration of the hardware.\nSolid lower stages are much simpler in this regard. At some point, the thrust will tail off until the booster no longer supports its own weight. At that point, it is jettisoned."

        "output": "If you open up a ```bash``` prompt and type in an ```echo``` command, that uses a shell builtin rather than running ```/bin/echo```. The reasons it is still important for ```/bin/echo``` to exist are:\n\n* You're not always using a shell. Under a variety of circumstances, you run an executable directly and not through a shell.\n* At least in theory, some shells don't have an ```echo``` builtin.  This is not actually required.\n\nTo expand on #1, suppose you wanted to move all the regular files whose names started with ```abc``` anywhere in ```src``` to ```dest```. There are several ways to do that but one of them is:\n```find src -name 'abc*' -type f -exec mv -nv {} dest/ \\;\n```\nBut suppose, rather than just running that, you want to see every command that will be run first. Well, then you can prepend ```echo``` to the command, just as you might in other contexts:\n```find src -name 'abc*' -type f -exec echo mv -nv {} dest/ \\;\n```\nBut ```find``` doesn't use a shell. That runs ```/bin/echo```.\nBesides ```find``` with ```-exec``` or ```-execdir```, the ```/bin/echo``` executable will be called by other programs that themselves run programs but not through a shell. This happens with the ```xargs``` command (which is related to ```find```), as well as in a number of other contexts, such as the ```Exec=``` line of a ```.desktop``` file. Another example is when you run ```sudo echo```, which can be handy for testing if ```sudo``` is working.\nSimilarly, some shells have a ```printf``` builtin but ```/usr/bin/printf``` also exists.\nA less common possible reason you might deliberately use ```/bin/echo``` is if you were relying on the differences between it and the ```echo``` command provided by your shell. ```man echo``` documents ```/bin/echo```; ```help echo``` in  ```bash``` documents the ```bash``` builtin. ```echo``` is not very portable, because different implementations--both across operating systems and across shells on the same operating system--support different options (e.g., ```-e```) and differ in their treatment of backslashes. Of course, it's better to avoid relying on such details, and use ```printf``` instead, which is far more portable.\nIn ```bash```, you can make the ```type``` builtin show ```/bin/echo``` as well--assuming ```/bin``` is in your ```$PATH``` as it always should be--by passing it the ```-a``` flag:\n```$ type -a echo\necho is a shell builtin\necho is /bin/echo\n```"

        "output": "Here are some common concerns about using tree planting projects to create carbon offsets:\n\n* The scheme actually has a net positive effect, both in the short and long-term/\nHow effective a tree planting scheme is in capturing and storing carbon dioxide, is for a large part determined by what happens to the trees after they are planted. When trees mature and are harvested for wood that's used in construction, then the captured carbon dioxide is stored for a long time (until the wood decomposes or is burned). However, if no trees are replanted after harvesting this will have had a one-time effect only. Also when wood is burned (for energy or in a wild fire), or if trees die quickly and decompose, then their captured carbon is released again. Of course all trees die eventually even when they are not harvested, this is part of the natural cycle, but a mature forest can store a lot more carbon than a young, newly-planted forest so it's important to keep a forest intact as much as possible.\n\n* The wrong type(s) of trees are planted in the wrong location.\nIn the past there were bad offsetting schemes that planted non-native trees, or planted trees in a location where they would change water flows  and thus change local ecosystems in a negative way. Some offsetting schemes planted  thousands of trees of the same species, resulting in a large monoculture. Such a monoculture hinders biodiversity, is susceptible to diseases and can even damage local communities.\nThere have also been reports that planting trees above a certain latitude can have a net warming effect by changing the albedo and trapping heat. \n\n* Buying offsets reduces the incentive for people to reduce their emissions.\nReducing emissions is much more effective than offsetting. Buying carbon offsets can lead to people thinking they are doing the right thing, whereas they had better spent their time and effort in reducing their emissions. Of course this point goes for all offsetting-schemes and is not specifically for planting trees.\n\n* There are more effective ways of reducing carbon emissions than planting trees.\nNowadays many offsetting schemes invest in development of renewable energy sources (in developing countries) instead of planting trees, simply because it is a more effective and cheaper way to reduce emissions."

        "instruction": "How to choose bridal lingerie?",
        "output": "Choosing bridal lingerie is one of the many exciting things you get to do as bride-to-be, and it’s something so personal that only you can do it. For lingerie that you’re planning to wear under your dress on your big day, you’ll need to choose a style that works well under your specific dress. If you’re planning to get other lingerie to change into after the wedding, you have unlimited options with which you can surprise your fiancé!\n\n## Find lingerie for your dress\n\n1. Go with a slip and shapewear if you have a sheath dress. Light flowing fabrics make beautiful wedding gowns but may require a little extra support underneath to avoid showing unwanted bulges or panty lines. Find shapewear that hides any problem areas, and a slip made from similar fabric as your gown in case your gown slips. To reduce the layers you need to wear, try a shaping slip in the same color as your dress.\n2. Choose high-waisted shaping lingerie for a mermaid dress. Mermaid dresses show off all your natural curves by hugging your body, so consider lingerie that draws in your waist and doesn’t show panty lines. A high-waisted thong is a good option, on its own or coupled with a bustier.\n3. Find a bustier or corset for your ballgown. Many ballgown style dresses already have a structured corset or bustier in them, but if yours doesn’t, find one that matches the color of your dress. Choose a bustier bra that’s seamless and strapless to support and lift your bust while slimming your torso. Panties for your ballgown can be any style you choose, since a ballgown is loose in the skirt area and you won’t be able to see panty lines.\n4. Choose any lingerie for A-line dresses. A-line, or princess-style dresses, are fitted at the top and flow out below the bustline. If this is the type of dress you have, you can choose any lingerie based on your comfort or preference instead of shaping or support. Keep in mind the shape of the top of your dress when choosing a bra; if the dress has a deep neckline or is strapless, you’ll want to find a strapless bra or skip a bra altogether.\n5. Find a backless bra with adhesive sides for a backless dress. If you have a halter or other type of backless dress, you may want support or coverage from your lingerie. Choose an adhesive bra that matches the color of your dress to get the support you need. Adhesive bras also work great for strapless dresses if you can’t find a strapless bra that you like.\n6. Match the lingerie color to your dress. Try bringing a swatch of the fabric that your gown is made from with you when you shop for lingerie. Some bridal gown retailers offer a swatch so you can match accessories with your gown. If you don’t have a sample of the fabric, try ordering more than one shade of lingerie and keep the one that best matches your gown. Matching your lingerie with your dress instead of your skin tone is helpful in case your gown slips a bit. Your lingerie won’t be as obvious if the shade matches your dress.\n\n\n## Choose wed night lingerie\n\n1. Wear whatever you’ll feel sexy in. There are certain myths surrounding wedding night lingerie that it has to look a certain way, but only you and your fiancé know what you like. This means if you don’t want to wear white, don’t! You can wear anything from boyfriend-style pajamas to French maid costumes, so don’t be afraid to choose something unique to you.\n2. Choose flowery white lace for the classic feminine look. If you want to go a traditional route, find a comfortable white or cream bra and panty set made from sheer flowery lace. Or go with a short white lacy gown. Some lingerie combines lace and faux-fur for an extra feminine touch.\n3. Try an artsy corset with suspenders, stockings, and heels for a bolder approach. If bold is more your style, think straps! Look for a detailed, beaded or embroidered corset with suspenders, fishnet or lace thigh-highs, and a pair of matching heels. Choose any color theme you like for this lingerie based on your preference. Some corsets have a connected underwear component with suspenders; others don’t, in which case, you can find a matching thong to complete your outfit.\n4. Choose a lacy jumpsuit or teddie if you like one-pieces. Find a lacy halter mini-shorts jumpsuit to combine sporty and feminine looks. Or go bold and feminine with a sheer or strappy teddie in any color that you like. To stay on the more traditional side, choose white or cream for your one-piece lingerie. Or choose a pastel pink or blue for a romantic, feminine effect. Black or red also work well with these pieces if you want a bolder look.\n5. Get a sheer dressing gown for some added luxury. Regardless of what style lingerie you get, consider a sheer dressing gown to drape over it, as an extra piece to remove on your wedding night, for lounging around in the morning, or both.\n6. Consider a separate registry just for lingerie if you’re having trouble deciding. If you like too many pieces to choose, let a few close friends and your fiancé choose for you! Create a registry online with a lingerie store, add some of your favorite pieces, and give your bridesmaids and fiancé the link before your bridal shower. This gives the people who know you best a chance to help you decide. You may end up with more than one item, but that’s okay. Choose one for your wedding night and save the rest for your honeymoon!\n\n\n## Consider your body type\n\n1. Choose strappy lingerie on a muscular frame. You can probably pull off some pretty daring looks if you’re in good shape. Choose lingerie with lots of straps, bold colors, or a cinched waistline to show it off.\n2. Try a plunging neckline and briefs if you’re pear-shaped. Pear-shaped women are smaller up top with wider hips, butt, and thighs. Show off this type of figure with pieces that go low at the neckline and brief-style underwear. Or experiment with colors by wearing bold, bright patterns up top.\n3. Go with v-cut panties and a full coverage bra or corset if you’re apple-shaped. Apple-shaped ladies carry more weight in the top half of their bodies and have slender legs. Show off this type of body by providing full bust coverage and concealing your stomach area, if you want to. Think lots of lace up top and brightly colored panties.\n4. Try a garter belt or any waist-cincher for an hourglass figure. Hourglass figures have a proportioned build with bust and thigh measurements that are about equal, and are slimmer at the waist. Show off your waistline with a flattering belt or any accessory that draws attention to it.\n5. Go wireless for a small bust. If you don’t need an underwire bra on your wedding day, don’t bother with one. Try a feminine lacy bralette or a racerback style bra if you have a small chest. You can likely find some cute halter one-pieces as well.\n6. Choose high-waisted bottoms for a long torso. If you have a long torso and shorter legs, you can choose from the variety of high-waisted styles that are so popular. Try a lacy crop top set with high-waisted bottoms to draw more attention to your shoulders and legs.\n"

        "instruction": "How to have a romantic relationship with an egotistic person?",
        "output": "An egotistic person can be someone who is prone to talking about themselves frequently, or someone who appears vain or boastful. It can also be used to indicate someone who is opinionated, self-centered, or selfish, as well. As you can imagine, being in a relationship with an egotistic person can have its challenges. If you feel you are dating an egotistic individual, work towards dealing with the egotism in the relationship. It is also important to communicate your needs to your partner, and make sure you are taking care of yourself\n\n## Deal with the egotism in the relationship\n\n1. Have a direct conversation about it. This is important and has a direct effect on your happiness, their happiness, and the success of the relationship. Don't waste time and energy trying indirect ways to “make her change.” It will just come across as manipulative and potentially cause resentment from your partner. Instead have a real, honest, and direct conversation about it. Start by letting her know you need to talk. ”Alice, I think we really need to talk. There's been something that has really be bothering me.”\n\t* Explain what the issue is for you; specific to your relationship. For example, if your partner is selfish or egotistical in conversations and making it about her, you could say, “I feel like when we talk, it isn't really equal. I love hearing about your day, but I'd really like for you to hear about my day too. When we talk, it feels really unevenly focused.”\n\t* Ask for her input: “What do you think?”\n2. Urge the person to grow and mature. One of the great things you get to do in a relationship is to build each other up and watch each other grow. Help your partner grow by growing with him. Instead of focusing just on the person, try shift the focus to the relationship or the both of you working on the same thing. You can try tasks like taking a relationship selfishness checklist test to increase your partner and your awareness of any selfishness in your relationship. Humans are social creatures and tend to unconsciously adopt the goals of those close to us. Just like couples who learn a sport, how to cook, or a new language together, you can learn how to be less selfish and opinionated together. Make sure to celebrate and praise each other for positive changes you are making. The better you both feel about it, the more likely you are to continue to work towards the goal.\n3. Be patient. This may be the most difficult part. If you are with an egotistic person, you may realize that changing these parts of yourself can take time. Much like breaking a bad habit, you may have to be patient with your partner as she works on changing. Additionally, expect some backsliding into previous bad behaviors during this transition time and try not to be too hard on her. One way you can address this is to have a funny thing you do or say if you notice your partner slipping back into her selfish habits. Agree to an action or a phrase during your conversation. If you make it something you both find funny, it can take the pressure off of pointing it out. The \"Cut it out\" hand motion Uncle Joey used in Full House. Playing a funny song such as Toby Keith's \"I wanna talk about me.\" Saying, \"Hold on, I haven't had enough coffee for this conversation yet.\" Pick something that is funny to you and your partner, like an inside joke that only you share.\n4. Boost the person's self-esteem. This may seem like a strange suggestion for an egotist, but often inflated egos and selfishness are rooted in low self-esteem or shame. Think of it as overcompensation. Your partner may have low self esteem causing him to exaggerate and inflate his outward display of what he thinks about himself. It turns out that he may be trying to convince himself of his greatness along with everyone else. Help him boost his self-esteem. Avoid complaining about him or harshly criticizing him as it will only make him feel more threatened. When you are talking to him focus on his strengths and try to draw on the potential of those strengths. Compliment him not just for his looks, but for how he acts and what he does.\n5. Accept that the person may never change. The most difficult part about any interpersonal relationship is when you realize that you have almost zero power to change someone else. People can change, but that change has to come mainly from them. They have to want it. So if you are intent on a relationship with an egotistic person, your first step is to be real with yourself about the likelihood of the other person changing and begin to accept the selfish parts of her personality that you may not agree with. While you cannot change other people, you can help them to change. You can also control how you react to their egotism and the effect you let it have on your life.\n\n\n## Communicate your need\n\n1. Make time to talk about you. Your egotist may tend to talk about themselves frequently and at great lengths. If you feel like your partner does not give you enough space to talk about you, address it. You deserve to have this relationship and this partner be as much of a sounding board as he expects you to be for him. Try addressing it directly, or making it more of a new pattern in your conversations. \"John, I really need to talk to you about something that is bothering me. I know you have things you want to say as well, but I really need someone to listen. Would you be willing to focus on just this problem and help me?”\n\t* Bring up topics more regularly that you are interested it. You may have gotten into the habit of just listening to your partner and letting him control the conversations. Start a new pattern of conversation by interjecting with topics you are interested in or thoughts you are having.\n2. Share your feelings. There is a solid chance that your egotistic partner is going to do or say something that makes you angry or sad at some point, because what you are doing is difficult and can be frustrating. Communication is key in any relationship, especially when you are working through some things. If you are really bothered by a particular action of your partner or by something she said, tell her. Try to add a compliment or a praise in and then tell her what upsets you, carefully and tactfully. \"Jane, I love it when you teach me how to cook. You are really good at it, and I want to learn. It just really hurts me when you tell it to me like I'm a nine year old kid.\" ”I understand you have a very strong opinion about this. Maybe you know more about it than I do, too. I would just really like for you to respect my opinion even if it is different than yours and not laugh at me for sharing it with you.”\n\n\n## Care for yourself\n\n1. Be true to yourself. Be careful not to change who you are in your relationship with an egotist. A selfish person will bring out the giver or the care-taker in you; which could be potentially harmful. Don't feel like you have to change yourself to accommodate him. Resist the urge to stifle who you are or even what you are good at out of fear of how your partner will react. Just as you may have to accept that your partner is selfish, he have to accept that you are going to be just who you are as well. That should just be one more thing he loves about you.\n2. Enjoy other interests. If you find you are the giver in the relationship and you feel that your partner is always taking, then invest some of your energy into other interests to protect yourself from the relationship imbalance. Make sure you are giving yourself and your interests the attention and care you deserve. Take classes or carve out time in your schedule to do things that you enjoy, focusing on self-care and your own needs. You can always put your giving energy into volunteering as well. Try organizations such as Volunteer Match.\n3. Acknowledge your feelings. Even if your partner is trying to change, there are potential pitfalls that come from being in a relationship with an egotist. You may be helping her change, being patient while she works through some things, and trying to boost her self-esteem. Make sure, during this time, you are staying aware of how you feel. There may be some ups and down, and it is important you remain aware of how it is affecting you. Keep track of how happy you are in the relationship and how your day-to-day life is being affected. Notice how drained or exhausted you are feeling and make sure to give yourself the time and attention needed to recover. Try not to let this relationship become all-consuming for your life. Spend time with friends, or work on a hobby or interest that is important to you. Set firm boundaries if she tries to push your buttons or engage you in a fight. You can say something like, \"I'm not going to respond when you're yelling at me like this. I'm going to go in the other room and we can talk again in an hour when we've calmed down.\"\n4. Find a support system. While you are navigating this change together, it is important that you both have support systems you can use as a resource. Use your existing support system or create one for yourself. Focus on people that help you and make you feel good about yourself. They should be people that you trust and feel comfortable with. They may include:\n\t* Friends\n\t* Family\n\t* Religious Community\n\t* Counselors or therapists\n5. Consider leaving the relationship if it is not making you happy. It is not always a healthy idea to stay with an egotist. He may not be able or willing to change in the way you need him to. If he is not willing to work on the relationship then this may continue to make you feel emotionally drained and unappreciated. It may be better for you to leave the relationship and move onto something that's healthier for you.\n"

        "output": "There are multiple reasons why people are/become Vegetarian/Vegan apart from ethics, including but not limited to\n\n* Religion/Culture - most of the worlds Vegetarians reside in India, mainly due to culture/personal beliefs but often interlinked with some of their major religions (Hinduism/Sikhism/Jainism etc) which promote the diet. Some strains of Buddhism also look positively at not eating meat, as does the Seventh-day Adventist Church.\n* Environment - reducing land degradation, climate change, reducing harm to bio-diversity etc. Animal agriculture causes a huge amount of problems to our planet and environment. \n* Health - another major point. Being Vegetarian or Vegan won't automatically improve your health of course (it's easy to live off junk food, believe me), but there are lots of scientifically proven benefits to eat a plant based diet over a standard Western diet including a lower risk of heart disease, lower BMI, lower cholesterol etc.\n* Political - a slightly less common reason but still; some people go Vegetarian or Vegan based on their political beliefs once they realise how much the two share intersectional values (e.g. from Anarchism to Veganarchism)\n"

        "instruction": "How to go to amarnath temple?",
        "output": "## Plan and prepare for the trip\n\n1. Plan to visit between June and August. Since snow and ice usually cover the cave temple, you won’t be able to access it during the cold winter and spring months. Wait until mid-June or July to plan your trip to the Amarnath Temple. Usually, the cave stays open through the first 1–2 weeks of August before it closes due to the terrain getting too difficult for travel. The actual dates when you can travel to the temple are chosen by the Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board (SASB) and it varies depending on the weather and how clear the trails are. You will not be able to reach the Amarnath Temple at any other time of the year.\n2. Get a Compulsory Health Certificate by a doctor approved by the SASB. Look at the list of approved doctors on the SASB website and schedule an appointment to see one. Bring the Compulsory Health Certificate from the site with you and fill out the self-assessment on top. Allow your doctor to run any tests to check if you’re fit for traveling to the Amarnath Temple. If they approve you for traveling, then you’ll be able to make the journey.You can find the Compulsory Health Certificate for 2020 here: http://www.shriamarnathjishrine.com/Yatra2019/CHC%20form%20for%20Yatra%20-%202020.pdf. The certificate you need changes each year, so make sure you’re using the proper one. Since the Amarnath Temple is 4,000 metres (2.5 mi) above sea level, it’s possible to get altitude sickness if you aren’t fit enough for the trip.Warning: You will not be allowed to go to Amarnath Temple if you are under 13, over 75, or more than 6 weeks pregnant.\n3. Submit a registration form online to the SASB. Select the date you want to travel to the temple on the calendar at the top of the page. Fill out the personal details on the registration form completely, including your name, birthday, phone number, and address. Then, list the clinic and doctor that completed your Compulsory Health Certificate. Upload a photograph of yourself and a scanned copy of the certificate before submitting the registration form.You can find the online registration form here: http://jksasb.nic.in/register.aspx. If you are accepted to travel to the temple, you will receive a text or email message about how to pay the 50 INR ($0.70 USD) fee. When you receive a permit, you must keep a copy on you at all times during your trip.\n4. Start taking 4–5 km (2.5–3.1 mi) walks 1 month prior to your trip. Start building up your endurance at least 1–2 months before your scheduled date of departure. Try to take the walks in the early morning or evening so you can get used to breathing in cool air. Continue taking walks each day up until you leave so you don’t get exhausted while you hike to the temple.You can also practice deep breathing exercises and yoga so you’re able to improve your oxygen efficiency. This will help you breathe easier when you’re at a higher altitude since there isn’t as much oxygen in the air.\n5. Pack warm clothes, waterproof shoes, a water bottle, and a walking stick. Only bring a lightweight, waterproof bag so you don’t get exhausted while you’re trekking to the temple. Opt for wool clothes that are waterproof so you stay warm. Make sure you use waterproof trekking shoes and a walking stick so you’re easily able to traverse more difficult terrain. Since you'll be active, opt for a reusable water bottle as well.Other things you may need for your trip include an umbrella, flashlight, hat, gloves, and a raincoat. The weather can be unpredictable and temperatures may dip below 5 °C (41 °F) during the night. You don’t have to bring tents or sleeping bags since there will be sites where you can spend the night.\n\n\n## Get to the temple\n\n1. Choose the Pahalgam route for an easier trek that lasts 3–5 days total. Select Pahalgam as your starting point if you want to follow the traditional pilgrimage route to the temple. While the trip does take longer to complete, it doesn’t have any steep slopes that are difficult to climb, and you can ride or use ponies during most of the ascent. You will hike about 48 kilometres (30 mi) if you go from Pahalgam to the Amarnath Temple. You don’t have to pay any additional fees to take the Pahalgam route.\n2. Pick the Baltal route for a steep climb that only takes 1–2 days round trip. If you’re an experienced climber or you feel like making the trip within a shorter amount of time, opt to start in Baltal, which is just north of the temple. Though the route from Baltal is much steeper than the path from Pahalgam, you can make the round-trip journey within a day.Plan to hike about 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) using the Baltal route. If you’re too tired to descend back to Baltal, you can opt to stay at a camp at the top overnight before leaving the next day. There are no other fees to take the Baltal route.Warning: Ponies are not allowed on the Baltal route since it’s too steep, so you will have to walk the entire way.\n3. Fly into Srinagar to get the closest to either base camp. Look for flights that come into the Srinagar International Airport, since it’s only 2–3 hours from both Pahalgam and Baltalhead. Try to schedule your flight into the airport 1–2 days before the date you’re scheduled to go to Amarnath Temple so you have time to travel.You can also fly or take a train to Jammu, but you’ll need to drive or take a bus further to to the base camps.\n4. Take a bus or taxi to the base camp you selected. Look for a bus or taxi service that runs from Srinagar to either Pahalgam or Baltal, depending on which route you plan on traveling. Typically, your ride will only last around 2–3 hours, but it may take longer depending on the road conditions.If you have a vehicle, you can also drive yourself to the base camps. Usually, there is some on-site parking, but it may be busy due to the number of travelers for the pilgrimage.\n5. Hire a helicopter tour if you don’t want to hike all the way to the temple. Helicopters fly out from both Pahalgam and Baltal, so you can reserve them for either base camp. Choose the date that you want to travel to the temple and reserve your spot. Arrive at the helicopter port on your scheduled day and take it up toward the temple. The helicopter will be able to take you as close as 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) away, but you will need to hike the rest of the way.Typically, a helicopter tour will cost around 3,600 INR ($50 USD) for a round trip.\n\n\n## Trek to the cave\n\n1. Carry your belongings in a waterproof bag. Store your clothes and everything you’ve brought with you in a waterproof bag or backpack so they don’t get wet. Use a bag that fits tightly on your shoulders and back so it doesn’t cause any strain while you climb up to the temple. Make sure you zip the bag at all times so water doesn’t leak inside or get your things wet. Weather can be unpredictable during your ascent, so it may snow or rain while you’re climbing to the temple.\n2. Stop at tea stalls or small restaurant huts for meals and drinks. Look for small huts or stands along the route to the temple to see what kind of food and drinks they offer. Pay for the rations and enjoy them at one of the camps along the route. Otherwise, save non-perishable food in your bag so you can have it later during your trek.Some stalls may charge for food while others volunteer and provide meals for free.Tip: Always carry some back-up snacks, such as dried fruits or nuts, with you so you can eat as you get hungry.\n3. Protect your skin with sunscreen or petroleum jelly. Keep a bottle of sunscreen or petroleum jelly in your bag so you have access to it whenever you need it. Apply it to your exposed skin and rub it in until it’s clear so it can absorb fully. After 2 hours, put on another layer so you stay protected from the sun.Petroleum jelly can also help keep your skin from drying out due to the cold, dry air.\n4. Rest at the camps set up along the route. Look for tents and huts along the route where you’re able to rest for the night during your trip. Pay for tent rental and take time to relax so you don’t feel too exhausted when you reach the shrine. Make sure your clothes aren’t wet before you fall asleep so you don’t get cold at night.If you’re shivering, slurring speech, experiencing blurry vision, or feeling nauseous, you may be experiencing altitude sickness. Rest as soon as possible and avoid climbing any higher.\n5. Pray to Shiva at the ice lingam when you reach the holy shrine. When you reach the Amarnath Temple, take off your shoes and enter the cave to see the ice lingam, which is a tall column of ice that’s considered holy. Say a prayer to Shiva while you’re next to the lingam before exiting the shrine.\n"

        "instruction": "How to celebrate chuseok?",
        "output": "\"추석\" or \"Chuseok\" is a Korean harvest festival celebrated on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar. It is a very popular festival for Koreans as they reunite with their relatives and prepare for a feast. The origin of Chuseok is unsure but it has some traditional rites to be maintained. Thus Chuseok is celebrated in the rich harvest season when fruit and grain are abundant. Using the newly harvested rice, people make steamed rice, rice cakes, and liquor.\n\n## Pray and traditional customs\n\n1. Perform Charye or 차례. This is an ancestral memorial service where the entire family gathers together to perform the memorial service in the morning wearing hanbok. Charye is performed because Koreans believe that their ancestors aren't physically dead; their spirits are still alive. They prepare special food in their honor. Observe the important table arrangement for the Charye feast. Rice and soup are placed on the north side of the table, and fruits and vegetables are on the south. On the west and in the middle, meat dishes are served. On the east, rice cake and some drinks such as makgeolli or soju are placed.\n2. Practice Beolcho \"벌초\" and Seongmyo \"성묘\". Visit the ancestral graves and clean the weeds around the graves. This shows respect and devotion to one another. One month prior to the Chuseok, the families visit their ancestors' graves to clean the weeds, a practice which is called Beolcho, often causing congestion in Korea's highways. They again visit and clean the weeds around the graves during Chuseok.\n\n\n## Entertainment\n\n1. Play Ssireum. A Korean folk game similar to wrestling, it is extremely popular during the festival. Two competitors wrestle in the center of a sandpit and try to knock the other person over by using strength, skill and intelligence. It is a one on one tournament and the last person remaining wins the game.\n2. Perform the folk dance Kanggangsullae. This is a folk dance especially performed by women. They usually link arms and dance in a circle under the moonlight.\n3. Perform Sonori or Geobuknori. \"So\" and \"Geobuk\" literally mean \"cow\" and \"turtle\" in Hangeul. This celebration is a ritual performed by two people wearing a cape made of hanji and running around the local area as a cow and turtle, asking for foods from neighbors. The foods are often shared with relatives who can't afford Chuseok meals.\n\n\n## Food\n\n1. Eat songpyeon or \"송편\". This is a Korean traditional stuffed rice cake served as the Chuseok meal. The stuffings are made of healthy ingredients like sesame seeds, beans, nuts and honey. It is crucial to steam those cakes on pine-needles. It enhances the taste and fragrance along with the meaning of Songpyeon. Songpyeon is also significant because of the meaning contained in its shape. Songpyeon's rice skin itself resembles the shape of a full moon, but once it wraps the stuffing, its shape resembles the half-moon. There's a saying that the prettier you shape your songpyeon, the prettier your future daughter will be.\n2. Enjoy Hangwa. It is made with highly nutritious ingredients, such as rice flour, honey, fruit, and roots. People use edible natural ingredients to express various colors, flavors, and tastes. A few types of Hangwa are Yakgwa, Yugwa and Dasik, which are widely common as Korean confectionery items.\n3. Note that the name \"Hangwa\" is similar to another name for Chuseok, \"Hangawi\".\n4. Drink traditional liquors. These drinks are another significant and traditional side for a Chuseok feast. On Chuseok, families and relatives gather together and hold a memorial service for their ancestors with liquor made of the newly harvest rice. After the memorial service, they sit together and spend some time together as a family, drinking the liquor and eating the food.\n"

        "instruction": "Nowadays each graphic card has some driver in operating system that translates some (typically) standard API such as OpenGL, so that programmers use some standardized API code to tell graphics cards how and what they want to render. (Actually that's already a bit hard-core most programmers really use various game engines that do this for them). In times of old computers - how was this done? Did every programmer of every game implemented all possible various API's that old graphic cards supported? Or did the old game studios from MS-DOS times had their own \"game engines\" that provided some abstraction when it came to these graphic cards? I remember there were many various card vendors and I remember old games asked me which one I have - so I suppose these games contained code / drivers for all these cards?",
        "output": "> Did every programmer of every game implemented all possible various API's that old graphic cards supported?\n\nYes - but it went even deeper than that. Early graphics cards had virtually no callable code associated with them at all, the concept of \"drivers\" had not quite become a reality yet. There was the concept of a Video BIOS, which were extensions to the ```INT 10h``` BIOS video services, that were effectively limited to initialization and switching video modes. \nInstead, graphics cards, at least in DOS land, all had memory mapped display RAM, and extensive documentation was available about exactly how setting various bits in display RAM would affect the pixels that appeared on the screen. There were no drawing APIs to call, if you wanted something to appear on the screen (whether it be a pixel, a character, a line, a circle, a sprite, etc) you would write the code to move the bytes into the right places in display RAM. Entire books were written about how to write efficient code to draw graphics.\nThere were some systems like the Borland Graphics Interface that abstracted graphics drawing primitives into an API with different drivers that one could call to draw things on different graphics cards. However, these were typically slower than what would be required for building action type games.\nAn action game would typically be optimized for a particular graphics display mode on a particular card. For example, a popular display mode was VGA 640x480 with 16 colors. This would be listed in the software requirements, and you needed to have the right hardware to support the game. If you bought a VGA game but you only had an EGA card, then the game would not work at all. As you said, some games would ask what you had and you had to know what the right answer was, otherwise the game would not work."

        "instruction": "How to clean plant leaves?",
        "output": "Clean plants are a beautiful addition to your home and garden, and do a wonderful job of purifying the air. Choose a cleaning method that is safe for your plant, especially if your plant is sensitive to water. Experiment with different shine agents to add a beautiful glow to your plant leaves. Each of these strategies will leave your plants looking clean and shiny.\n\n## Remove dust and grime\n\n1. Wipe large, shiny leaves with a damp cloth. This is the best way to clean large plants, such as rubber plants, that are difficult to move. Dunk your cloth in water and then squeeze out any excess liquid. Gently wipe both sides of all of the leaves to remove any dust and grime. Microfiber cloths or cheesecloths work well for cleaning plants. Clean the leaves each time that you notice dust or dirt building up. This works well for both indoor and outdoor plants such as Gunnera, Plantain Lillies, and Elephant Ears. Place a drop of dishwashing liquid on the cloth if you notice insects eating or landing on your plant.\n2. Use a soft paintbrush to remove dust from plants with fuzzy leaves. Plants with fluffy leaves, such as African Violets, are quite delicate and shouldn’t be wiped. Instead, gently brush any dust or insects off the leaves with a clean, soft paintbrush. If you don’t have a soft paintbrush on-hand, use a pipe cleaner or soft toothbrush instead. Avoid wetting the leaves of fuzzy plants, as this can cause water spots to appear.\n3. Rinse indoor plant leaves with warm water to remove insects and dust. Place your indoor plant in the sink or shower and use the pressure of the water stream to remove any dust and dirt from the plant. The mist from the shower will also help to hydrate the plant’s leaves. Leave the plants to drip-dry and then take them outside to dry in the sunshine. Always use warm water, as cold water can leave spots on the leaves. Don’t wash plants, such as cacti and African Violets, that are sensitive to water. This method works well for Peace Lilies, Sword Ferns, and Devils Ivy.\n4. Dunk small plants into water to quickly get rid of dust. Place your hand over the soil to keep it in place and then turn the plant upside down and submerge the plant in room temperature water. This is a great option for small houseplants and outdoor plants. Allow the plants to drip-dry out of direct light.\n5. Spray compressed air onto cacti to avoid getting them wet. Cacti are used to desert conditions and will often wilt and die if they are over-watered. Spray air from an air compressor can over the spikes to dislodge any dust or dirt from the cacti. Hold the can 10 centimetres (3.9 in) away from the cacti to avoid damaging the spikes. Purchase an air-compressor can from a hardware store or a plant nursery. This works well for both spiky and smooth cacti.\n\n\n## Add shine\n\n1. Rub a thin coat of mayonnaise over the leaves to keep them shiny. Squeeze a little mayonnaise onto a paper towel and wipe it over the leaves. Cover the entire leave with a light enough coat that it cannot be seen. Remove any excess mayonnaise with a clean paper towel. This shiny coating will last for approximately 2 weeks. Simply reapply the mayonnaise to restore the shine of the leaves. This method works for all types of plants.\n2. Cover the leaves in a thin layer of mineral oil for a long-lasting glow. Mineral oil provides a shiny coating for the leaves and helps to prevent dust from accumulating quickly. Simply place a drop of mineral oil onto each leaf and use your fingers to evenly spread it over the top side of the leaf. Use this method on any type of plant. Avoid using coconut or olive oil on the leaves, as this can block the pores of the plant. Keep plants with mineral oil on them out of the direct sun to avoid the leaves from getting burnt. Reapply the mineral oil once or twice per year.\n3. Spray a commercial plant shining product onto the leaves to add sheen. These sprays are specially formulated to keep your plant leaves looking shiny. Liberally spray the product over all the leaves on your plants. If you are spraying outdoor plants, choose a product that is designed for outdoor plants. Purchase a plant shining spray from a plant store. Follow the application instructions on the packet. This is a great option for cacti, as you don’t have to touch the plant.\n"

        "instruction": "How to select an open source content management system?",
        "output": "## Choose an open source cms\n\n1. Research your options. A quick Internet search will tell you that WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, Plone and Blogger are probably the most common; however, there are dozens more. Make sure you are testing a CMS, rather than a vendor, as the names may be easily confused in the beginning. Many online reviews say that WordPress CMS is good for blogs, and Drupal is great for community-oriented sites, with a lot of user interaction. Joomla! works well for the most basic websites and users. Plone is a newer CMS that manages documents and community very well. You should make your own decisions based on what looks best for your site.\n2. Decide what experience you want to give your website visitors. Sit down with your marketing or branding department and make a list of the essential parts of a website, so that you can look for them in your CMS. This will help you to choose the frontend designs you prefer. You can also get a private web development company to design your template and plug in an open source CMS. This is considerably more expensive than simply choosing a ready-made design through an Internet-based service. It may allow you extensive customization of your site.\n3. Decide what you need from the backend of the CMS. For example, decide if you need search engine optimization (SEO) features, mailing lists, events applications, customization, scalability or a specific programming language.\n4. Test drive each programming platform. Assign 2 to 3 people who will be working with the programs most to do a trial run, or \"sandbox\" version, of the CMS. They should report back with reviews and rate them according to overall preference. Open source CMS can all be installed for free. You may need to hire a web programmer to install them, if no one in your organization is very computer savvy. You still want to test the backend of the system with the non-technical users. You can also go to opensourcecms.com to try over 70 open source CMS programs for free. The site will allow you to do a demo without having to install the whole program.\n5. Check if your web hosting service automatically installs any of the open source CMS. If you use shared server hosting, then the tech support you pay for may include installation of 1 of these programs. If so, and you like the program, you can save money that would otherwise go toward hiring a programmer.\n6. Read community reviews of the open source CMS or extensions you want to install. Each open source program has a web-based community that helps users ask and answer questions. You can get an idea of how easy it will be to accomplish the things on your marketing list by searching for reviews and instructions.\n7. Choose a CMS according to website functionality and employee functionality. Compare each CMS/template with the frontend/backend list you made. Choose the program that fulfills the most preferences on your lists.\n\n\n## Implement an open source cms\n\n1. Decide how you want to do installation and support. Since open source CMS are available to all, they have community forums that help with support. However, if you aren't very proficient with computer programming, you will have to follow an alternate method. Hire a web vendor to install the program and train your staff. Although you will need to pay for this service, it will decrease the problems you will have with the open source CMS. Ask if the vendor offers tech support help in the future at a fee. Task your IT department with installing and training staff. You may have to send part of your staff to a course to learn all about the program and its requirements. If you already have a fully competent IT staff, you will save money with this option. Install the program yourself and train your staff. If you and your employees are very computer literate, it may not be essential to get outside support. You can look for plugins in the directory and read how to fix problems in the forums.\n2. Be prepared for an adoption period. After changing any database, you should be prepared for a slow period where your employees learn to use the program, and at times, there are complaints. Try to wait for a period of 30 to 90 days before deciding if the CMS will work, because most website changes take time to adjust to.\n3. Look to enhance your open source CMS. Look for extensions and plugins, once your employees are completely functional with the backend. The great thing about CMS is that talented volunteer programmers are improving it all the time. Subscribe to blogs, newsletters or forums about your CMS blog. This will keep you aware of new updates or plugins. It will also direct you to websites that use the CMS so that you can see what others are doing with it.\n"

        "instruction": "How to become hot?",
        "output": "Being hot is more than just a look—it's a frame of mind. Whether you're just walking down the street or stopping to have a quick conversation, if you hold yourself in  confidence then everyone in your orbit will be thinking you're hot in no time. But what if you're not sure if you can be the sexy, intriguing, and hot person that you want to be?\n\n## Think hot\n\n1. Allow yourself to want to be hot. Maybe you want to look like a hot guy or girl, but you're afraid you’ll be judged or looked down on. For some, wanting to be hot has negative connotations of someone being too vain or shallow. Don’t let these stereotypes and misconceptions stop you from achieving hotness. Give yourself permission to become hot. Being hot should be something you want and not something you feel pressured to be. Today’s society puts a lot of importance in looking attractive in a certain way, but it’s not necessarily the only way to be attractive\n2. Exude self-confidence. In order to be hot, you have to believe you’re hot. Have confidence in your decisions, in the way you look, and in who you are or want to be. It will also help you bounce back from setbacks and accepting difficult challenges that come your way. Remind yourself of what you’ve already achieved and enjoy these successes. Don’t forget how much you’ve accomplished and the goals you’ve reached in the process of trying to reach a new one. Don’t put too much importance on how others perceive you. If looking hot makes you feel happy, then that’s more important than what others might think.\n3. Have realistic body image goals. You don’t have to look like a model. You should be the shape you're happy with. Half of that means changing your body through exercise and eating healthy, but the other half is accepting your body's own uniqueness. It's understandable to want to reach a healthy weight level, but it's not realistic to achieve a tiny waist if you're naturally top-heavy or try to make your butt bigger if it's naturally petite. Don't ignore your own assets in the process of trying to mimic someone else's. Avoid labelling a certain body type as the “perfect” body. There are many kinds of bodies that are beautiful in their own way.\n\n\n## Dress hot\n\n1. Figure out what body shape you have and dress to flatter it (for women). A great outfit should accentuate your best features and minimize unflattering parts of your body. Here are some ways to dress some common body types:\n\t* \n\t* Apple or circle shaped: Counter the roundness and softness of your body by adding structure to your outfit, especially on top. Wear a fitted blazer or wrap dresses that create asymmetrical lines across your body. Straight-legged pants help elongate your legs and draw attention to your body vertically. Large prints and patterns will flatter you better than small prints, especially if worn on top. Avoid covering yourself up with large or loose shirts – instead, wear more form fitted items or clothes drape down your body. Pear or triangle shaped: Balance out your great hips by creating layers on top. A cardigan or a jacket cropped at the waist helps even out your slender top half with your curves at the bottom. Show off those great shoulders by wearing one-shouldered shirts or shirts with embellished collars. Boot-cut or slightly flared pants paired with high heels will elongate your legs. Hourglass shaped: You’ve got the shape everyone is looking for! To better show off those sought-after curves, dress simple. Items in solid colours with cinched waists show off your small stomach. Avoid prints that take away the spotlight from your silhouette. Athletic or ruler shaped: Your slender body can sometimes look too boxy so avoid stripes or cropped shirts. Try fitted tank tops with smaller straps, or halter-tops that enhance the look of your bust. High-waist pants and skirts give the illusion of that hourglass shape. Stick with soft fabrics that flow off your body to counter the hard lines of your athletic build.\n2. Invest in clothes tailored for your body (for men). Learn what fit suits your body best or go to a tailor to have your clothes fitted for you. There’s nothing worse than wearing clothes that are too baggy or too tight in all the wrong places. Shoulders: The seam where the sleeve attaches to the body should rest on top of your shoulders. They should not hang down onto your arms. Arms: The fabric under your armpits should be tapered to your skin but still allow motion for your arms. Chest: Your chest should fill out the front of your shirt so that its shape can be seen through the fabric. You should also have a full range of motion in your arms. Try reaching up, back, and forward. If you can’t do those things, then your shirt is too tight. Buttons that looked pulled and cause wrinkles are another tell tale sign that your shirt is too tight. Sleeves: If you’re wearing long sleeves, the cuff of your shirt should stop just at the base of your thumb. Pants: If you’re opting for a slim-cut or skinny pant, make sure there is a straight cut from your knees to your ankles. The cuff of your pants should never create flaps or pool at your feet. They should stop just at the ankles or little past your shoes. Belts: They should really only be a way to accessorize and should not actually be holding up your pants. If a belt is the only thing keeping your pants on, then they’re probably too big. Shoes: Many stylists claim shoes are the foundation of men’s looks. An outfit is dependent on the colour and type of shoe you're wearing. So dress from the shoes up.\n3. Polish your look by matching simple colours with bold statement pieces. Solid coloured clothing items make statement pieces pop. Choose statement pieces like large earrings, patterned shoes, a colourful bag, or a fancy hat. Black is always hot and matches with almost anything. An all black outfit gives you a clean look but also gives you a little edge and mystery. Use the power of contrast to your advantage. Darker coloured clothing can help you achieve a more slender look or mask unappealing features. While patterns or light coloured items can highlight areas of your body you’d like to show off.\n4. Follow fashion trends. Fashion is always changing so keep up with the latest trends to stay hot. Although, not every trend is worth following or is flattering on everyone so pick what will look good on you and what fits with your style. Avoid age-inappropriate fashion trends. Being hot doesn't mean looking younger or more mature.\n5. Show off a little skin or wear a form-hugging outfit. A bit of sexiness can go a long way when you want to look hot. However, make sure it’s an appropriate amount of skin. You’ll know when you’re being too revealing when:\n\t* It gets in the way of forming meaningful relationships. We live in a sex-fuelled society, so it’s not surprising when people can’t help but look at bare skin. It can make people perceive you differently or draw focus away from what you have to offer and more towards what you look like to them. If this type of attention is not what you want, then it’s not the right moment to show off too much skin. It prevents you from furthering your career or getting hired. In most work environments, showing off too much skin is discouraged. You receive negative or dangerous attention. It’s difficult for many people, especially women, to show off skin without attracting negative attention. And since you can’t control other people’s reactions and actions, your safety and comfort should always come first.\n\n\n## Look hot\n\n1. Radiate confident body language. It's not always enough to just dress the part, but you have to appear hot. And a few tricks to improve your body language can help:\n\t* Stand tall and with purpose. Stick your chest out and keep your hands from fidgeting. The power position is often described with the image of Superman with his hands at his hips, chin high, and legs apart. Move steadily with your actions. Talking too fast or doing things in a hurry shows that you're nervous or anxious. Have a variety of expressions on your face and body. Confident people are able to express themselves naturally but won't overdo it. This makes you more approachable and open.\n2. Get in shape. Whether you want to achieve a certain body weight goal, or just become more physically healthy, getting in shape is a great step towards becoming hot. Invest in a gym membership or a personal trainer. With a trainer’s guided advice and encouragement, you can start to work on areas of your body and achieve weight goals in a safe and effective way. Eat healthy. Cut down on junk foods and start eating a better balanced diet. Exercising and eating well will make you feel more comfortable in your own skin and improve your overall mental health as well.\n3. Have good posture. Improving your posture not only makes you look more confident, but also has many health benefits. Fixing your posture can reduce head and back pain, inflexibility, and prevent compromised muscles. Assess your posture so you can work on your body’s problem areas. Generally, your shoulders should be balanced and one shouldn’t appear higher than the other. They should also be aligned with your ear so your neck and head aren’t jutting forward. Your back should not be rounded and your arms should relax at your sides. Do posture-improving exercises everyday. They can be simple exercises like straightening your back while sitting, walking more, or stretching out those kinks. Or they can be more complicated exercises that stretch and form your back to the correct posture. Be conscious of how you hold yourself. It’s easy to start slumping forward when you’re working at your desk or sitting down and relaxing. Make an effort to sit in the correct position with your back straight, arms back, and head and neck aligned with your shoulders.\n4. Choose a trendy haircut that compliments your look and face shape. Try dyeing your hair, cutting it extremely short or getting extensions to mix it up every once in a while and give off a dynamic appearance. Take care of your hair. The simplest thing you can do is wash your hair and condition it. Invest in hair products or natural remedies to fight problems such as frizzy, dry, or greasy hair. Get a haircut every month or two to avoid split ends and the unkempt look.\n5. Develop a skin care routine. Your skin is the foundation of your look. Keep it clean and clear of blemishes and other problem factors by treating and protecting it. Try out different products to make sure they’re right for your skin. Wear sunscreen. It’s the easiest thing to forget but a little sunscreen every day can prevent wrinkles and skin discoloration. Moisturize your skin. Use lotion, cream, or body butter for your hands, arms, legs, and face. Lip balm helps with chapped or cracking lips. For oily skin, use oil-free products to cleanse your face. For acne prone skin, avoid touching your face or popping your pimples. Instead, wash your face with an acne cleanser or warm water and hypoallergenic soap and keep your skin well moisturized. Acne develops when oils, either from your fingers or overactive hormones and glands, mix together with dirt to clog up your pores.\n\n\n## Act hot\n\n1. Show your cool side. Ironically, being hot means being cool. It’s a likeable quality to have that attracts people to you because of your laid back demeanour. A few cool things to do:\n\t* Don’t try so hard. Or at least look like you’re not trying so hard. It gives the impression that you’re so smooth, you can get want you want without even trying. If you fidget a lot, bite your lip, stumble in your speech or am just generally nervous, try feeling cool. It’s hard to monitor or stop the nervous little ticks our body does when we're nervous so the best way to go about it is from the inside out. Feel cool and your body language will follow. Be a little rebellious. Sometimes a little rule breaking or risk-taking is very cool and makes you appear powerful. But don't do anything illegal!\n2. Play up your sex appeal. There are many ways to be sexy and look sexy. Try:\n\t* Wearing red. There have been numerous studies that the colour red is the sexiest colour. Something in our human brains are highly attracted to the colour. Smiling. Looking happy and approachable is very sexy. So flash does pearly whites! Making strong eye contact. This is a highly confident move that draws people in. Pair it up with a smile or flirtatious look to amp up the sexiness. Flirting. It’s a sexy and fun way to communicate with someone you’re interested in. Subtly draw attention to your body or tease your target with flirtatious looks or bold compliments.\n3. Be humble. The worst thing you can do is brag about how hot you are. Modesty and being gracious to others are attractive qualities. The most confident people are those who are able to build others up. Give compliments. If you want to attract someone’s attention, pay them a genuine compliment. Don’t brag and look down on others. The attention that comes with being hot can easily develop into a large ego. Your friends, family and other people will be turned off by someone who constantly needs to prove they’re hot or thinks too highly of themselves.\n"

        "instruction": "How to tell if it's an acquaintance, friend, crush, or love?",
        "output": "Feelings and emotions can be complex and difficult to understand, especially when trying to decipher those of someone you know.  Are you simply an acquaintance?  Do they consider you a friend?  Is it love or just a crush? There are many layers to relationships and it's not always clear where you stand with someone.  However, there are several different methods to decode how a person feels about you and perceives your relationship.\n\n## Read body language\n\n1. Notice the amount of eye contact. People’s eyes can be very expressive and tell a lot about how they’re feeling toward those around them. Friends will make eye contact with each other during conversation to show interest and respect. Someone with a crush on you will make repeated eye contact with you whether in a conversation or not. A crush may hold eye contact for a few seconds, and then look away from shyness, and find your gaze again later. Dilated pupils are another indication of a crush. Someone who’s in love with you will feel totally comfortable locking gazes for extended periods of time.\n2. Gauge proximity. The amount of space people choose to place between themselves and others can be an indicator of their perceived relationships with those around them. Someone who is your friend will stand or sit closer to you than an acquaintance. A person with a crush on you will stand near you, lean toward you, and look for reasons to get closer to you- whether it’s intentionally walking past you at a close range, or leaning in closer than necessary to talk to you. People who are in love will stand or sit very close together- perhaps their hips touch when standing side by side or their knees touch when sitting across from one another.\n3. Monitor movement. Our movements, whether conscious or unconscious, can convey lots of different meanings about how we feel about those around us. Friends will tilt their heads while in conversations with other friends to show that they’re listening. They may touch each other in light, casual ways on the hand or arm. Someone with a crush will look for reasons to touch the other person, often in a playful and flirty way. They may seem fidgety or nervous, and may subconsciously begin to copy the movements of their crush. Someone who is in love with you will seem very comfortable and secure around you. They may touch you using gentle, caressing gestures.\n4. Pay attention to posture. The way a person stands (or sits) when they're around you may give you some clues as to how they feel about you. A friend will stand with his or her shoulders and face pointing toward you. If sitting, he or she will uncross his or her legs to show that he or she is open to you. His or her palms may be open toward you as well, another sign of receptivity. When someone has a crush on you, they stand tall and slightly stick their chest out. Additionally, they will point their toes and hips toward you, as a sign of wanting to move toward you (both figuratively and literally).\n\n\n## Listen for verbal cue\n\n1. Recognize vocal tone. The inflection and quality of a person’s voice will change subconsciously depending on the feelings they have toward you. Listen to how someone talks in general, and compare it with they sound when talking to you individually. A friend’s voice will remain constant, with little to no change in pitch or tone. A crush’s voice will have a playful and flirtatious quality to it. Women use a higher pitch to accentuate their femininity. Men use a lower pitch, but alter the pitch, almost to a “sing-song” tone, to both highlight masculinity, and make a woman feel at ease. People who are in love will alter their voices to match their partners’. Men talk in a higher pitch and women a lower one to show that they are connected as one.\n2. Think about how casual your conversations are. A conversation between friends is usually casual and comfortable. Both you and your friend ask and answer questions equally, and may or may not make future plans to hang out.\n3. Notice how much they talk about themselves. If someone has a crush, they will talk a lot about themselves, both from nerves and as a way to “humble-brag.” They will also ask about you, and agree enthusiastically with what you say to make it seem like you have things in common.\n4. Analyze how intimate your conversations are. If someone is in love with you, they will open up to you in intimate ways. You may find out about their deep insecurities and fears, childhood, family dynamics, important personal values, and vision for the future. They may plan future vacations, or invite you to meet family.\n\n\n## Analyze your relationship\n\n1. Reflect on your relationship. Take some time in a quiet place simply to think about your feelings toward the person in question, and your interactions with them. Some questions to consider are:\n\t* How long have you known this person? How frequently do you see or talk to them? Is the communication equitable? What is the level of intimacy shared (either physically or conversationally)? How would you characterize your time together? Do you both seem to enjoy being together?\n2. Make a list. If you’re trying to determine whether someone is a friend or a crush, make a “Friend/Crush” list. If you’re figuring out whether someone is in love with you, make a “Like/Love” list. Like a Pro/Con list, record any specific behavior that would indicate how they feel about you. Having a visual aid way may give you more insight into how they feel.\n3. Ask a trusted friend for help. Sometimes our feelings toward someone can cloud our judgment in assessing their behavior. A friend can offer an honest, objective observation of the relationship, and will be less likely to allow personal feelings to affect their understanding.\n\n\n## Ask directly\n\n1. Express your feelings first. If you’re asking someone to open up to you, then you need to be upfront with them as well. If you’re looking for honesty, you need to show you’re capable of reciprocating. People are more likely to be direct with you if you’re direct with them. Start with a sentence like, \"I want you to know that I feel\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_about you/our relationship. I'm hoping you'll be just as honest and share your feelings about me.\"\n2. Ask in a tactful, non-threatening way. Explain that you’re simply trying to gain some insight and clarity in your relationship, and that you respect their feelings no matter what. It’s important for your partner to know that they can open up to you, without an abrasive reaction. Try saying something like, \"I want you to know that I will completely honor and respect your answer, even if it's not the one I want to hear.\"\n3. Be prepared for the consequences. There’s a chance you and your partner may be on two different wavelengths in terms of your relationship. Their answer may sting a little. Take some time to decide how you want to proceed in the relationship, knowing exactly how your partner feels about you.\n"

        "instruction": "How to make quinoa lasagna?",
        "output": "Quinoa lasagna replaces standard lasagna noodles with quinoa. If you want a meatless version – which doesn’t require pre-cooking the quinoa or vegetables – opt for the vegetable lasagna, with mouth-watering mushrooms, spinach and onion in a red sauce. The spinach and chicken version has similar ingredients, but is prepared differently. The quinoa is rinsed, drained and boiled first, and the veggies are sauteed on the stovetop before baking the lasagna. Pair either lasagna with a complimentary beverage, and serve vegetables and dipping bread on the side.\n\n## Bake vegetable lasagna\n\n1. Chop vegetables while the oven preheats. Preheat the oven to 375 °F (191 °C). Use a large chopping knife to dice the mushrooms. Dice the onions more finely than the mushrooms.\n2. Line a greased casserole dish with veggies and quinoa. Spray the dish generously with coconut oil cooking spray. Place the spinach, mushrooms and onions into the dish. Sprinkle the uncooked quinoa on top.\n3. Mix up the marinara in a medium bowl. Combine the marinara sauce with the vegetable broth, cottage and ricotta cheese, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, sea salt and ground pepper. You can use 1% cottage cheese and full-fat ricotta cheese, or opt for whatever type you like of each.\n4. Combine the marinara with the contents of the casserole dish. Pour the marinara mixture over the veggies and quinoa. Mix all of the ingredients together with a large spoon. Ensure that the sauce mixture mostly covers the other ingredients.\n5. Bake the covered casserole for one hour. Cover the dish with tin foil. After 30 minutes, remove the lasagna and stir it. Replace the foil cover and put the dish back in the oven for another 30 minutes. At the halfway mark, it’s normal for the dish to appear a bit watery.\n6. Add the toppings and cook for two minutes. Arrange sliced tomatoes and shredded mozzarella to the top of the lasagna. Replace the tin foil. After cooking, let the dish cool for about ten minutes before serving it.\n7. Refrigerate or freeze leftovers. Store the lasagna in an air tight container. Refrigerate for up to five days. If freezing, allow the lasagna to cool completely first. Let it thaw in the refrigerator overnight before re-heating. Try a glass pyrex dish for refrigeration. Try a disposable aluminum casserole dish for freezing. Add a sheet of plastic wrap on top of the lasagna and push all of the air out before wrapping the whole dish in tin foil.\n\n\n## Make spinach and chicken lasagna\n\n1. Boil the quinoa in a small pot. Add rinsed and drained quinoa to a pot with 1½ cups (350 ml) of water. Bring the contents to a boil over high heat. Turn the heat to low and put a lid on the pot. Continue cooking for about fourteen minutes. Remove the pot from heat and let it sit, covered, for five minutes. Fluff the cooked quinoa with a fork. The quinoa is finished cooking when the liquid has all been absorbed.\n2. Sautee onion, garlic and mushrooms. Heat olive oil over medium heat in a large saucepan. Pour in the vegetables. Cook for five minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender and the onions are translucent.\n3. Cook ground chicken with the veggies. Over low to medium heat, cook the chicken for six to seven minutes in with the onion, garlic and mushroom you just sauteed. Use a spatula or wooden spoon to break up the meat as it cooks, until it is no longer pink.\n4. Add spinach, tomatoes and seasonings. Add spinach to the saucepan and cook it for two minutes, stirring continually, until the spinach leaves wilt. Mix in tomatoes, basil, salt, red pepper, oregano and sugar. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for about ten minutes, until the mixture thickens. Remove from heat. The mixture must be thick, not runny, for the lasagna to set properly.\n5. Combine quinoa, cheese and sauce as the oven preheats. Preheat the oven to 375 °F (191 °C). Add the quinoa, ricotta and 1/2 cup (95 g) of grated mozzarella into the sauce mixture and fold it in, then mix well. Pour the mixture into a baking dish. You can use a 9” (23 cm) x 13” (33 cm) oven-safe casserole dish.\n6. Add the topping to the lasagna. Smooth the top of the lasagna with a spatula. Sprinkle the rest of the mozzarella on top in a single layer. Pour the Parmesan and breadcrumbs on top.\n7. Bake the lasagna for 30-35 minutes. Allow it to cool for at least five minutes before you serve it. The lasagna is done when the top is bubbling and lightly browned. If you want it browner, you can put it under the boiler for about a minute at the end.\n8. Refrigerate or freeze leftovers. Store your lasagna in an air tight container. Refrigerate the lasagna for up to five days. If you want to freeze it, allow the lasagna to cool entirely first. Allow it thaw in the refrigerator overnight before re-heating. For example, you can refrigerate the lasagna in a glass pyrex dish with a lid. For instance, place the lasagna in a disposable casserole dish. Add a sheet of plastic wrap on top, then push all of the air out. Wrap the entire dish in foil, and freeze.\n\n\n## Compliment quinoa lasagna\n\n1. Serve the lasagna with vegetables. Add chopped fresh basil to the top of the lasagna, or fresh basil leaves on the side of the plate. Serve a tossed salad, steamed vegetables, or roasted vegetables alongside the lasagna. For example, thickly-sliced, cooked zucchini goes well with quinoa lasagna. Serve cooked spinach, or fresh spinach as a side salad. Make sweet potatoes, which go well with quinoa lasagna.\n2. Serve complimentary beverages. Red sauce goes well with a glass of red wine. If you prefer white, opt for something crisp and dry. Other options are non-alcoholic beer, or sparkling water with muddled herbs. Try a red wine from southern Italy, such as from Tuscany. Another option is a light Sicilian red wine. Try a white wine like Pinot Grigio or Verdicchio.\n3. Serve thick, crusty bread with dipping oil on the side. Combine olive oil with lemon juice, grated Parmesan cheese, and dried herbs/seasonings, to taste. For example, try 1/4 cup (60 ml) olive oil, a squirt of lemon juice, and a teaspoon (4 g) of Parmesan. Tap out a small sprinkle – 1/2 teaspoon (2 g) or less – each of dried basil, parsley, thyme, oregano, black pepper, rosemary, salt, and red pepper. Mix in 1/2 teaspoon (2 g) of minced garlic, if desired.\n"

What's going to be even more laughable is when you try to use it in the radiation shielded environment of your escape pod. The signal, which is line of sight at the best of times, most likely won't even penetrate the hull. So now you need to hook it up to the external antenna used by the pod's own comms system.\n\nOr you could look at the pod comms system and see what's wrong.\n\nNow you need to make sure you're using the right broadcast method: are you on AM or FM?

Since even day scripts would never run on the 31st day of longer months, you don't lose anything using 30 days as the base for even-days, and by specifying specifically to divide it up as if there were 31 days you can force odd-day execution.\n\nThe syntax would look like this:\n```# Will only run on odd days:\n0 0 1-31/2 * * command\n# Will only run on even days:\n0 0 2-30/2 * * command\n```\n\nYour concern about months not having the same number of days is not important here because no months have MORE days than this, and for poor February, the date range just won't ever match the last day or two, but it will do no harm having it listed.\n\nThe only 'gotcha' for this approach is that if you are on an odd day cycle, following months with 31 days your command will also run on the first of the month.

        "instruction": "How to make your dog more playful?",
        "output": "Some dogs are naturally more playful than others. Additionally, some breeds are also generally more sociable than other dog breeds. If you’re dog seems bored, lonely, or unhappy, there are many ways you can try to address their malaise. In order to make your dog more playful, it’s important to play with your dog regularly, bond with your dog, and pay attention to your dog’s needs. Making your dog more playful will make both you and your pet happier in your relationship.\n\n## Play with your dog regularly\n\n1. Play fetch or other retrieving exercises with your dog. Dogs like to chase and retrieve items, including bones and balls. If you can, try to train your dog to come to you before you throw the item and then bring it back to you once they retrieve it. Say “come” and get your dog to approach you. Get your dog to sit by putting the ball on their forehead and stating “sit”\n\t* When you throw the ball, tell your dog to “get it”. After they retrieve it, tell them “bring it here” to have them take it back to you to throw again.\n2. Get or make dog toys for a variety of activities. Show off the toy to your dog, but don’t play with it immediately. Try tug toys or braided rope toys that you can play back and forth with them. You can also try teething or training toys that can strengthen your dog’s teeth. Talk excitedly to your dog about the toy by saying things like “Where is it?” in reference to the dog toy. If your dog wants to play, they should begin wagging their tale and get excited. When you take out the dog toy, play with it first before you start playing with the dog. Use the toy to play with the dog for a brief amount of time before they get tired with it. This will help build their excitement for the next time you break out the dog toys.\n3. Play hunting and hiding games with your dog. Dogs like finding people and objects that are hidden. These types of games can stimulate your dog’s mind and their senses. While your dog is in the other room, hide in another room. Call them to come and find you. When they do, give them treats and dog toys to reward them. You can also hide doggie treats somewhere in the yard or in a room. When your dog comes into the room, they should sniff around in search of the treat. Give them encouragement when they get closer or farther away from finding the treat.\n4. Invite other dogs over to play. Your dog might get happy when he's around other dogs. For many dogs, having some friendly play with their fellow canines can be engaging and exciting. Your dog may like to roughhouse, but make sure things do not get out of hand. When they are play fighting, dogs will often avoid really biting the other dog and roll over often. If your dog is growling when playing with other dogs, their play fighting may have escalated into real fighting. You can also tell if they begin baring their teeth while wrestling with the other dog.\n5. Teach your dog tricks. Dog tricks can be fun, but also very useful. While there are many different tricks you can teach your dog, a few essential tricks can really show off your dog’s ability and make them more playful. Rollover is one easy trick to teach your dog. When your dog is lying down, move a food lure across its muzzle, neck, and shoulders. Use the command “Roll over” while doing so to get them to associate your command with the action. Stay can also be a very useful command. Ask your dog to sit in front of you while holding a treat and maintaining eye contact. If they are able to stay still, reward them with the treat and add the command “Stay” so they know what to do when you state the command. A “Go to” command can be useful in directing your dog. With a treat, walk to a whichever place you want them to go and place the treat there. Eventually, they will associate the place with the treat and with your specific “Go to” command.\n6. Take your dog to a dog park. Dog parks can a fun place for your dog to play with other dogs. It’s important for your dog to be able to play well with other dogs, so they don’t get into any fights with other dogs. After you’ve walked around the park with the dog to make sure it’s safe, you can take off their leash so they can run around. You’ll want to know where your dog is at all times, but not having a leash gives them greater freedom to roam around the park. If you have a small dog, try to bring them specifically to a section of the park with other small dogs. Otherwise, they may get overwhelmed.\n\n\n## Bond with your dog\n\n1. Show physical affection to your dog. Dogs like physical affection, and it can bond them closer to their owners. Spend time petting or grooming your dog nearly every day. Dogs can be sensitive to touch at first. Touching them each day can build up their sensitivity and get them to crave your touch. You can also groom them on a regular basis. Just something as simple as brushing their coat with a brush can show your dog physical affection.\n2. Spend one-on-one time with your dog every day. Even if you're at work all day, it's good to have some time alone with your dog. Taking your dog for a walk every day can be a good way to reaffirm your bond with your dog. If you go on a walk with your dog, make it an engaging activity for your dog. Instead of walking aimlessly, try to give your dog specific goals and landmarks to walk or run to that you can do together. Talk to your dog or teach them a trick. If you try a new trick every few weeks, this will bond you and your dog together and keep them focused on doing well for you.\n3. Do focused activities with your dog. Dogs like to have structure, since it gives them a clear sense of purpose. When you play with your dog, try to make them task-oriented. Give them directions on where to run, jump, and play. Playing catch is a good example of directed play. Dogs also like to please their owners. Focused activities can tell your dog that they have fulfilled your expectations and you're happy with them.\n4. Give praise to your dog. When you are training your dog, it’s especially good to give positive reinforcement. Additionally, praising your dog can make you grow closer together. While treats may be the most common type of positive reinforcement, it’s also important to speak to your dog positively. They will associate your tone of voice with your mood and feel happy as well. If your dog does not respond to treats, a toy may also be a good way to praise your dog. They may also like physical affection from you, such as being petted, as a method of praise.\n5. Start obedience training. Dogs like to be trained, since they like structure. You can either have your dog join a class or do it just with you. In either case, you should be heavily involved in any training with your dog. If you are training your dog, always use positive reinforcement. Dogs like treats and voice training (like \"Good boy\") that tell them they are doing well. Pay attention to your dog's mood. They need to be in the right mood for training. Otherwise, it will not be an effective training session and will be frustrated with you and your dog.\n6. Take your dog to a training or activity class. If you're working a specific skill or behavior, a training or activity class can be fun for you to do with your dog. These classes can be good for you and your dog to use to bond over a shared activity. Activity classes can work from puppies to adult dogs. For puppies, these activity classes may be especially useful to teach them discipline and some general training. If you have a new dog that's not a puppy, it may be a good idea to bring them to a training class. Even if they are trained, you and your dog could use the class to learn how to work together.\n\n\n## Pay attention to your dog’s need\n\n1. Know your dog's likes and dislikes. Since not all dogs are the same, every dog has different things they like and don't like. Paying attention to things like their favorite and least favorite things let them know you care. Your dog likely has favorite foods, toys, and games. Give them these things, so they will affiliated their favorites with you. Stay away from things you know your dog dislikes. Some things that all dogs dislikes are head pats, hugging, floral smells, and loud noises.\n2. Read your dog's body language. Your dog gives you plenty of clues how they feel. Watch your dog during activities and you should be able to tell if they are enjoying them or not. When your dog is playful, they are performing a \"play bow\". In the play bow, their rear end is up and their front end is down. Dogs that are whining, pacing, or doing anything unusual are usually stressed or fearful. These activities show you that your dog is not ready to play and likely needs to calm down. Tail wagging can mean many things. While a loose wag means your dog is open and comfortable, a tight wag can mean they are agitated.\n3. Put yourself in a calm state of mind. Very often, your dog's mood will reflect your mood. If you are happy and playful, your dog is more likely to also be happy and playful. Dogs try to read your intention. If you seem uncertain about your intention, they may try to guess; often, they may guess incorrectly. Be clear even when you are calm. Dogs like directions, so it's good to tell them what you want and when.\n"

        "instruction": "How to make felt?",
        "output": "Felting is fun no matter what your age. Once you learn the process of felting, you can let your imagination be your guide and move on to other, more complex shapes. Felt sheets are the most basic, but felt balls can be just as fun to make.When you are done, you can turn your handmade felt into pretty patches or beaded garlands!\n\n## Make a felt sheet\n\n1. Use your fingers to pull apart some wool into tufts. Do not cut the wool into tufts. This will create sharp edges and make it difficult to felt. Also, be sure to get pure wool and not acrylic; acrylic fibers will not felt. Many crafters will recommend Merino wool for its fine fibers. The wool does not have to be naturally colored! Consider getting some dyed wool!\n2. Lay the tufts out on a baking sheet, overlapping each row like scales on a fish. Make sure that the fibers are all going in the same direction. You do not have to cover the entire baking sheet; an 8 by 8 inch (20.32 by 20.32 centimeters) square will be plenty.\n3. Lay out more tufts in a second layer with the fibers going perpendicular to the last one. For example, if all the tufts were going up-and-down in the first layer, make all the tufts go side-to-side in this layer. You can also experiment with using a different color of wool for this layer. Be sure to use a color that complements the first one, however, or you might get a muddy result.\n4. Repeat the first two layers, if desired, for a thicker felt sheet. Remember to alternate the direction in which the fibers are going with each layer. Two layers is perfectly fine for a thin piece of felt, but if you'd like something thicker, aim for three or four layers total. Consider adding some pieces of loose-weave fabric or bits of Merino yarn on top for color and texture.\n5. Cover the layers with a piece of tulle or sheer polyester fabric. This will help keep the fibers in place during the felting process. The fabric needs to be big enough to cover the entire wool sheet.\n6. Make your felting solution and pour it into a spray bottle. Keep the rest of the felting solution handy to refill the bottle as needed. You will need 1 tablespoon of dish soap and 1 quart (950 milliliters) of hot water. Don't shake the bottle, or you will create too many suds. The hotter the water is, the faster the wool will felt. The water shouldn't be so hot that it is uncomfortable to work with, however.\n7. Spray the wool down, then gently massage it with a piece of soapy bubble wrap. Don't be tempted to pour the water onto the wool. This will cause the fibers to move around too much. Instead, spray it down with your hot, soapy water until it is completely saturated (but not dripping). Ball up some bubble wrap, rub it over a piece of bar soap, then gently massage the felt using small, circular motions. If you accidentally soaked the wool, use a small sponge to mop up the excess water.\n8. Continue pressing on the wool until the fibers come together. Pour the water off as it cools, and spray more hot, soapy water onto it. Be sure to tuck in any loose or stray fibers as you work. This will make the edges of your sheet a little more even.\n9. When the wool is ready, transfer it to a sheet of bubble wrap and peel off the tulle or polyester fabric. You can tell if the wool is ready by doing a simple pinch test. Pinch a piece of the wool between your thumb and forefinger. If it stays in place and doesn't come off, you can move on the to the next step. If it lifts away, then continue pressing the wool. The bubble wrap needs to be textured side up.\n10. Roll up the bubble wrap tightly. Start by folding an inch (2.54 centimeters) of so of bubble wrap over the bottom edge of the felted wool to create a seam. Next, roll the wool up as tightly as you can along with the bubble wrap, starting from the bottom. Press down as you roll the wool to drain off any excess water.\n11. Roll the bubble wrap tube across a flat surface for about five minutes. Roll it gently at first, then with increasing pressure later on. Don't over-felt or over-work your wool.\n12. Rinse the sheet with cold water, then squeeze it to drain off the excess water. The cold water rinse will help set the fibers. Gently press down onto the felt sheet to squeeze out the excess water. Do not wring or twist it. Consider adding a splash of white vinegar to the water. This will remove excess soap and restore the natural pH of the wool; it will brighten the wool's colors and help it last longer.\n13. Lay the wool out some place flat to dry. The wool will have shrunk and thickened during the felting process. It may also shrink a little bit more while it dries. This is completely natural.\n14. Use your felted wool. You can cut it into squares and sew it onto a bag to make patches. You can also cut it into circles to make coasters. The possibilities are endless!\n\n\n## Make felt ball\n\n1. Pull apart some raw wool into tufts. Do not cut the tufts. If you cut them, you will get sharp edges that will be harder to felt. You can use natural, uncolored wool, or wool that has been dyed bright colors. The size of the tufts doesn't really matter, but a 4 to 5-inch long (10 to 12 centimeters) tuft will give you a bead about the size of a cherry.\n2. Fill a small tub with hot water and add some liquid dish soap into it. You will need 2 tablespoons of dish soap for every 3 cups (700 milliliters) of water. Gently swish the water to mix, but not so much to create suds. The hotter the water, the faster the wool will felt. The water shouldn't be so hot that you can't handle it, however.\n3. Gather a few tufts into a ball, then roll them between your palms. Don't worry about forming a firm ball just yet. You can use all one color of wool, or several different colors for a more interesting felt ball.\n4. Soak the ball in the hot, soapy water. Hold the ball between your fingers, then dip it into the hot, soapy water. Don't worry if the ball starts to lose its shape and sag. You will reshape it in the next step.\n5. Roll the ball between your palms until it becomes firm. The ball will be loose at first, but then it will start to become more firm. This will take about 10 minutes. Be careful not to squeeze it too much. If you are making multiple beads, the water may cool down while you work. When that happens, replace the tub with more hot, soapy water.\n6. When the wool is firm, rinse it off with cold water. This will get rid of the soap and help set the fibers. If you'd like, you can then soak it in some water with a splash of white vinegar in it. This will help remove the rest of the soap and brighten the wool's color.\n7. Gently press the ball in a towel to remove excess water. Be careful not to squeeze too hard, of you may distort the ball.\n8. Allow the felt ball to air dry. This will take about 24 hours. Remember, just because the ball is dry on the outside does not necessarily mean that it is dry on the inside.\n9. Consider threading the balls onto some twine to make a garland. Poke a hole through each ball using a darning needle, and pull some heavy thread through it. You may need to use needle nose pliers to help pull the needle through, especially of the felt balls are firm. Hang the garland wherever you like when you are done.\n"

        "instruction": "How to peacefully feed cats in multi‐cat households?",
        "output": "## Feed multiple cat at once\n\n1. Feed discrete meals. Feeding all of your cats at one time, instead of letting them graze, will minimize conflict and fighting. Instead of allowing access to food at all times, which can lead to conflict when two cats want to eat from the same bowl at the same time, timed meals will allow all cats to have their own space and food to focus on. How often you feed your cats each day depends on your schedule. In many cases, it works best to feed your cats once in the morning before you leave and once again in the evening when you return. Provide food puzzles if you have a cat(s) that is used to grazing instead of eating at meal times. This will help them transition to timed meals. Putting a small amount of kibble in one of these puzzles won't replace a whole meal but it may satiate a cat enough until meal time comes around.\n2. Monitor feeding time. Do not feed your cats and then leave your home. It is important that you monitor feeding time, so that you can make the cats stay at their own feeding stations and break up any conflicts that might occur. It may be that your presence calms your cats while they eat because they know that they will be protected from other cats trying to get their food when you are around. This will allow them to focus on their food more than on defensiveness. If you see a cat trying to eat another cat's food, physically separate them. It's important that you do this so the more submissive cat doesn't get taken advantage of.\n3. Remove food dishes after 20-30 minutes. When feeding multiple cats you should remove food dishes after the cats have eaten or after 20-30 minutes, if one or more of your cats are very slow about eating. This will teach the cats that there is a set time to eat and if they don't eat at that given time, then there is no food to be had. The goal is to make meal time a time for strictly for eating, not a time to play games, show dominance, or fight for territory. Setting specific meal times and taking away food when meal time is over requires a gradual training process that may take some time for your cats to adjust to. If your cat meows repeatedly at you for food when it is not meal time, just remember that you are working to make a peaceful household and your cat will not starve if it has to wait an hour for food.\n4. Use calming sprays. If your cats are very territorial and tend to fight over food, you may want to try using a calming product made for cats during feeding times. These products tend to be non-toxic sprays that use pheromones to calm cats and reduce fear and aggression. Spray one of these products, which are usually available at most pet stores, around the feeding area or on the specific cats that are most fearful or aggressive. The pheromone sprays used for calming cats mimic the pheromones given off by mother cats to calm their kittens.\n\n\n## Set up separate feed station\n\n1. Give each cat its own dish. When feeding multiple cats, competition can be fierce if every cat doesn't have its own dish to eat from. Separate dishes allow each cat to have their own space and their own food to focus on, instead of focusing on defending against another cat. Make sure that the food bowls are as identical as possible. You do not want to create competition for a food dish that is easier to eat out of or is slightly bigger. Don't forget to place a water bowl near each food bowl. In most cases, when you first set out multiple food dishes the cats will naturally gravitate to one of their own. Once they have basically picked their bowls, make them stick to them to establish their territories.\n2. Don't place food dishes against walls. In many cases, a cat in a multi-cat household will want to be in a position while eating where it can see any other cats coming towards it. If you place food dishes against a wall, the cat will naturally be forced to have its back to the wall. This may add to its anxiety and not allow it to relax during eating. Placing your cat's bowl even a foot away from the wall should allow it to sit in any place around the bowl that it feels is best.\n3. Place the cats as far away from each other as possible. When feeding cats in a multiple cat household, you need to space them away from each other. This may mean that you place food dishes in separate corners of the same room or you place feeding stations in completely separate rooms. Giving all your cats space from other cats will allow them to better focus on their food instead of turf wars or food competition. It is ideal if your cats cannot see each other during meal time. This add tremendously to your cat's ability to focus on food instead of the other cats.\n4. Isolate cats eating different foods. If your cats eat different food, it is important that you feed them in different spaces. This will help you to keep each cat eating the food that it is supposed to eat and it will prevent fights over whatever food your cats consider the tastiest. It may be that one of your cats eats different food and your other cats eat the same food. If this is the case, only the cat with different food needs to be isolated during meal time. Cats that are eating different food need to be kept separate until all cats in the household are done eating. The will remove the temptation to sneak a bite from the bowl of the last cat eating.\n5. Try adding an extra feeding dish if problems persist. Adding 1 more dish than the number of cats you have can help eliminate any chances of conflict. With an extra bowl, your cats won't have a problem finding somewhere to eat in peace. For example, if you have 2 cats, you could try adding a third feeding dish. If you add an additional feeding dish, make sure you put a water dish nearby.\n\n\n## Avoid conflict\n\n1. Coax cats to their own bowls. If more than one cat goes to one bowl at mealtime, you should coax the cat away who does not normally eat at that bowl. This could be done by picking the cat up, calling to it, or luring it towards its own bowl with a bit of food. This separation will prevent territorial disputes and conflict during meal time. There can be power dynamics between cats that they need to sort out themselves. When cats are initially establishing whose dish is whose, there may be some switching up that occurs.\n2. Stop fights right away. When fights break out over territory or food you should break them up right away. Fighting over food, especially between cats who usually get along, can lead to unhealthy aggression, so it should be stopped before it gets serious. If you have two cats that repeatedly fight over food dishes, these cats should be fed in different rooms.\n3. Avoid conflict before it starts. In order to have a peaceful household with multiple cats, you may need to resort to keeping certain cats away from each other most of the time, which includes meal time. This will allow you to avoid conflict before it begins and it allows both cats to have peaceful and calm time in their homes. If you have a very small home, this can be difficult to achieve. Keeping cats that don't get along separated works better if you have a large house or at least several rooms that can be closed off. You can also try feeding aggressive cats in cat carriers. That way they won't be able to run around and harass your other cats when they're finished eating. While it is true that some cats may have conflict at first and then learn to get along, that is not always the case. If you have tried to get your cats to get along and nothing seems to work, it may be time to give them separate territories in your home.\n"

So the broadcast signal is modulated using a 'Gold Code' (in the case of the oldest public GPS signal) where part of the signal transmitted by the satellite is already known by the receiver - the GPS receiver can pick out the signal despite how faint it is, by tracking the cross-correlation between the received and expected signals.\nThis also means multiple satellites can transmit their signals at the same frequency - so long as they use different gold codes, the receiver can track both signals independently.\nNewer GNSS signals replace gold codes with newer techniques - like 'multiplexed binary offset carriers' - which perform better, but do basically the same thing."

        "instruction": "How to help first graders with spelling words?",
        "output": "Helping a first grader learn to spell can be both challenging and rewarding. Whether you're a teacher, a parent, a grandparent or a volunteer, there are ways to help a child with spelling words. The best strategies to encourage a young speller are based in knowing more about a child's spelling ability, and the early stages of writing.\n\n## Teach spell strategies\n\n1. Assess students' spelling knowledge. The best teaching practice starts with learning what the student already knows. Take a moment to check the students' knowledge of spelling by asking them to spell a list of common first grade words. Assessment allows you to start teaching at the area of your students' competence. Words found at the first grade level are short, 1-4 letters long. They are 1 syllable words. Examples of first grade words are: a, to, at, boy, bad, dip, cat, nest, sand, play. Assessment continues by analyzing students' independent writing. Provide opportunities for your students to write, whether in art projects or academic activities. Continue assessing throughout the school year. Ongoing assessment is vital for effective teaching practice.\n2. Teach in small groups. Most teachers are aware of the disparity between their students' abilities and know that small group instruction is preferred when possible. In helping first graders with spelling, it's essential to teach in small groups. Group assignments should be based on what you've discovered through your spelling assessments, so that students of similar spelling abilities can be taught at the same time. Be aware that some students' reading and their spelling abilities may be quite different. Don't base spelling assessments on students' ability to read. Have other students engage in word-related activities at their seats, or participate in literacy activities in the classroom's centers, will help you manage the other students while working with small groups. Having an assistant or a classroom volunteer can be helpful to managing the small groups of students.\n3. Prioritize spelling instruction. You'll need to find the time to assess and teach spelling to your first graders. This can be difficult to manage, because it requires individualization to the child's learning ability. Plan ahead to include spelling instruction every day, multiple times per day. Consider creating inclusion of spelling words in different areas of study. Invest a little time every day in independent word work and individual or small group instruction.\n4. Teach word knowledge, not just spelling. Teaching sight words, words that the student is likely to encounter often, helps the first grader with spelling. Post familiar words around the classroom. Teach students to consider why the word is spelled as it is. Teach the rules behind the spelling. For example, teach the reason for the silent e, and how it affects the sound of the word. Adding an e to a simple 3-letter word usually makes the vowel long, rather than short. Teach sight words that don't usually fit the standard first-grade curriculum, if you find the students' using these words frequently. Post these words around your classroom, and refer to them when they naturally arise in other teaching. These sight words might include: because, are, again, said, friend, were.\n5. Demonstrate usefulness of spelling. Students will be more motivated to learn to spell if they understand its importance. A first-grader must be taught the connection between reading words and proper spelling. By teaching students to recognize the power spelling has over understanding, you'll help them transfer their spelling knowledge into other activities of their life. Group activities can have multiple fill-in-the-blank opportunities. Mad Libs is a great activity for teaching spelling. Teacher scaffolding can help support beginning learners. Reminding the student what she already knows, strategies she might try to complete a spelling word, and providing hints and encouragement all support a first grader with spelling.\n6. Integrate strategies for independent spelling. When you're helping your first graders, say each word you want them to spell slowly. Teach your first graders to listen for the sounds they hear (initial sound, middle sound, final sound). Help them identify any part they might know, e.g., br in brought. Encourage students to notice how words come together to make a larger word. For example, putting fun and silly together to make funny. Students might enjoy clapping the syllables, then writing letters for each syllable. Help the students identify different spellings of rhyming words, such as space and place, or here and there. Students need lots of opportunities to try the correct spelling to see if it looks right. Provide resources around the classroom - dictionaries, calendars, charts, word walls, etc.\n7. Encourage all writing, regardless of spelling. Writing and spelling are two different academic areas. Having students write, without worrying about their spelling, will help them become more confident writers and spellers. Provide opportunities for students to write about things that are important to them: football games, video games, school outings, or pets are popular topics. These learning opportunities are found throughout the students' day. Make games out of writing about new topics.\n8. Expose students to written words. The more a child is exposed to written words, the more likely he is to internalize the spelling of the word. If you're working on particular spelling words, point them out in books, magazines and online. Highlight with a marker to emphasize that the word he's learning is also found in the \"real world\" if possible. Students may enjoy \"proofreading\" for spelling mistakes. First graders may appreciate reading the same stories over and over again. If this is the case, take advantage of this repetition to highlight different words found within the same story.\n\n\n## Recognize the early stag of write\n\n1. Know the signs of the pre-communicative writing stage. A first grade child may be still at the pre-communicative stage of writing, which means that he only has a rough idea of the alphabet. Your first grader may recognize different letters of the alphabet, but be unaware of words as a visual construct. Spaces between words may not be noticed. For children in this stage, continue to teach alphabet shapes and expose the child to written words through reading aloud with him. Never attempt to correct the spelling of a child at this stage of writing.\n2. Learn about the semiphonetic stage of writing. By first grade, some children will be at the semiphonetic stage of reading. A this stage, the child is making a connection between the sound of the word and the sound of a letter or two within the word. He may dramatically abbreviate the word, such as using T or D for dog. The word that the child may attempt to spell first may be his name, or the M for Mom or D for Dad. Children's ability to segment, or separate, the distinct sounds of a word may be still emerging. Encourage a child to write often, no matter how difficult the word may be to read. Don't worry about spelling at this stage, but provide help if the child is open.\n3. Know about the phonetic spelling stage. This is a common stage for first graders, a stage of spelling that assumes basic knowledge of the alphabet and understand that words and sounds are connected. A speller at this stage may use \"invented\" spelling patterns based on the sound of the word.Children at this level will be more interested in learning correct spelling. Provide models of correctly spelled words, and start to encourage them to think about how to spell words for themselves. This is a wonderful stage to start to help a child with spelling. Examples of invented spellings might be kam for came, wel for will, fes for fish, etc. Another thing you might notice is that the child starts to recognize beginning patterns in words, noticing rhymes and similar sounds.\n4. Learn more about the transitional spelling stage. A few first graders might already be at the transitional stage of spelling. At this stage, the student will have emerging reading skills and recognize many words. They begin to understand that sounds are represented by letter combinations, and that words can be made plural or altered in other ways by suffixes and prefixes. Being patient with mistakes at this stage is essential. The words might actually be more difficult to understand than with a phonetic speller, but the child's spelling mistakes are based in an inadequate understanding of spelling patterns. Continue to teach the patterns that make for good spelling. Teach the child how to laugh at spelling inconsistencies as are so often found in the English language. Reminders of appropriate spelling can also be taught at this stage, such as \"I before E, except after C, unless it's an A as in neighbor or weigh.\"\n"

        "output": "Decision diagrams (DDs) are most effective when they can compactly represent a large (perhaps exponential) set of solutions. This is done by merging equivalent states in each layer. To make decision diagrams scalable, we can use relaxed decision diagrams which allow merging nodes that are not necessarily equivalent. Relaxed decision diagrams provide dual bounds on the objective function -- a larger width can produce a stronger bound.\nThe relationship between the size of the decision diagram and the underlying combinatorial structure of the problem is well studied in the computer science literature; see for example the textbook by Wegener. The most important feature that influences the size is the variable ordering. We can use this to come up with some general guidelines on when a DD may be successful for combinatorial optimization:\n\n* The problem has a sequential structure, and decisions for stage $i$ depend only on the decisions made in stages $i-k$ through $i-1$, for small $k$.\n* The induced width of the constraint graph of the problem is small.\n* For a MIP model, the constraint matrix has a small bandwidth.\n* For knapsack-like problems, the maximum `budget' is relatively small.\n\nNote that in some of the above cases, precise characterization of 'small' may yield (pseudo-)polynomial bounds on the size of the exact DD. In practice, relaxed DDs will always have polynomial size.\nThere are several areas of combinatorial optimization in which decision diagrams have been successfully applied:\n\n* Sequencing and routing problems. For example, single machine scheduling with setup times, time windows, and/or precedence constraints, which can also be applied to constrained traveling salesperson problems. A similar decision diagram representation was used by Grubhub to solve pickup-and-delivery problems.\n* Decomposition and embedding in MIP models. Decision diagrams have been used to represent subproblems in MIP models that are otherwise difficult to linearize. For example, to represent nonlinear objective functions, constrained employee schedules, or nonlinear circuit design. DDs have also been used in column generation.\n* Graph-theoretic problems. Examples include set covering, maximum independent set, and maximum cut.\n* Constraint programming. Constraint propagation based on (relaxed) decision diagrams can be much more effective than propagating domains of individual variables. This was first demonstrated on overlapping alldifferent constraints."

        "output": "One current practice that future generations might consider disgusting or immoral is the contemporary form of meat consumption.\n\nIn the not-too-distant future, technological advances could enable synthetic meat production that will be indistinguishable from farm-grown meat in both taste and nutritional value. This method of meat production won’t involve the suffering or killing of animals, and will have much less negative external effects (e.g. farmland areas, carbon emission). So, after this method becomes affordable to the masses, consuming meat that originated from livestock might be severely frowned upon, as there are equivalent alternatives with much less negative by-products."

        "instruction": "I grew up in a country where we were not allowed to leave/travel to an other country even when we were able to do so – we had the resources and dual nationality.\nAfter two decades I still can't figure out why dictators, like Kim Jong-un for example, ban people from leaving their home countries?\nCould it be that a dictator is usually interested in looting the country he rules, and having a smaller population means more natural resources for him and fewer protesters?",
        "output": "People are resources, dictators (and oppressive regimes in general) don't want them to defect to other countries because they want them working for their regime. Some of them are going to be people that the regime has put their resources into, like scientists and doctors, but even laborers are valuable for actually gathering and assembling the resources the regime needs. Additionally, the regime especially does not want people with access to sensitive information to defect to their enemies. That isn't just spies and soldiers, there are plenty of \"regular\" government positions that require access to something the regime would not want falling into enemy hands, like economic data that could be used for propaganda. Obviously this is true of any country, and even in democracies with strong human rights records, people with access to classified information are usually required to submit to strict scrutiny of their international travel. Given that they aren't concerned with human rights, dictatorships can take the easier option of restricting travel to any citizens.\nHowever, defection is really a piece of a bigger issue - oppressive regimes maintain their rule in part by controlling information. Here's an interesting article that talks about how dictatorships keep power. Jerrold Post, director of the political psychology program at George Washington University, is referenced:\n\n  Post said that in both Iraq and North Korea, dictators tightly controlled the flow of information. That control was upended in the past two years during the \"Arab spring\" revolts that swept away despots in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and some of the Gulf states, revolts that were encouraged in large part by information spread by cell phones and social media. \n\nNorth Korea is probably the most extreme example of information control (according to Reporters without Borders, they are dead last in Press Freedom in the world), but this can be seen in other oppressive regimes - for example, China attempts to limit access to \"wrong\" information via its Great Firewall. This is thrown out the window if citizens go somewhere with free media and realize they are being lied to. Traveling can be the cause of their dissension, rather than a symptom.\nKnown dissidents may also be restricted from traveling so that they can not coordinate with foreign countries or anti-dictatorship organizations, and to prevent them from smuggling contraband or evidence of the regime's misinformation back into the country. Regimes can control the information originating in their country, but once someone is outside their borders the regime cannot control who they speak with."
